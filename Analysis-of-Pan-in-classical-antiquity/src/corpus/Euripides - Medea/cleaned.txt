enter the nurse from the central door of the skene
nurse
would that the argo had never winged its way to the land of colchis through the darkblue symplegades would that the pine trees had never been felled in the glens of mount pelion and furnished oars for the hands
of the heroes who at pelias command set forth in quest of the golden fleece for then my lady medea would not have sailed to the towers of iolcus her heart smitten with love for jason or persuaded the daughters of pelias to kill
their father and hence now be inhabiting this land of corinth separated from her loved ones and country at first to be sure she had even in corinth a good life with her husband and children an exile loved by the citizens to whose land she had come and lending to jason himself all her support this it is that most rescues life from trouble
when a woman is not at variance with her husband
but now all is enmity and loves bonds are diseased for jason abandoning his own children and my mistress is bedding down in a royal match having married the daughter of creon ruler of this land
poor medea finding herself thus cast aside calls loudly on his oaths invokes the mighty assurance of his sworn right hand and calls the gods to witness the unjust return she is getting from jason she lies fasting giving her body up to pain
wasting away in tears all the time ever since she learned that she was wronged by her husband neither lifting her face nor taking her eyes from the ground she is as deaf to the advice of her friends as a stone or a wave of the sea
she is silent unless perchance to turn her snowwhite neck and weep to herself for her dear father and her country and her ancestral house all these she abandoned when she came here with a man who has now cast her aside the poor woman has learned at misfortunes hand
what a good thing it is not to be cut off from ones native land
she loathes the children and takes no joy in looking at them and i am afraid that she will hatch some sinister plan for she has a terrible temper and will not put up with bad treatment （i know her） and i fear
she may thrust a whetted sword through her vitals slipping quietly into the house where the bed is spread or kill the royal family and the bridegroom and then win some greater calamity for she is dangerous i tell you no man who clashes with her
will find it easy to crow in victory
enter tutor by eisodos a escorting the two sons of jason and medea
but see her boys are coming home after their games they have no thought of their mothers troubles it is not usual for young minds to dwell on grief
tutor
aged slave of my mistress household
why do you stand alone like this at the palacegate complaining of your troubles to your own ears how can medea spare your service
nurse
old attendant to the children of jason to trusty servants it is a disaster when the dice of their masters fortunes
fall badly it touches their hearts so great is the grief i feel that the desire stole over me to come out here and speak my mistress troubles to the earth and the sky
tutor
what does the poor woman not yet cease from moaning
nurse
your ignorance is enviable her misfortune is still beginning and has not yet reached its peak
tutor
poor fool （if i may speak thus of my masters） how little she knows of her latest trouble
nurse
what is it old man do not begrudge me the news
tutor
nothing i am sorry i said as much as i have
nurse
i beg you by your beard do not conceal this from your fellowslave i will keep it a secret if i must
tutor
as i approached the gamingtables where the old men sit near the holy spring of peirene i heard someone say （i was pretending not to listen）
that creon this countrys king was going to exile these children and their mother from the land of corinth whether the story is true i do not know i could wish it were not so
nurse
but will jason allow this to happen
to his sons even if he is at odds with their mother
tutor
old marriageties give way to new he is no friend to this house
nurse
we are done for it seems if we add this new trouble to our old ones before weve weathered those
tutor
but you hold your peace since it is not the right time for your mistress to know this and say nothing of this tale
nurse
o children do you hear what kind of man your father is towards you a curse on him but no he is my master yet he is certainly guilty of disloyalty towards his loved ones
tutor
as what mortal is not are you just now learning this that each man loves himself more than his neighbor some justly others for the sake of gain seeing that their father does not love these boys because of his bride
nurse
go into the house children all will be well
and you keep them as far off as you can and do not bring them near their mother in her distress for i have seen her turn a savage glance at them as if she meant to do something to them and she will not let go of her wrath i am sure before she brings it down on someones head
but may it be enemies not loved ones that feel her wrath
medea
within
oh what a wretch am i how miserable in my sorrows ah ah how i wish i could die
nurse
just as i said dear children your mother is stirring up her feelings stirring up her anger
go quickly into the house and do not come into her sight or approach her but beware of her fierce nature and the hatefulness of her wilful temper
go inside as quickly as you can
exit tutor and children into the house
it is plain that she will soon kindle with even greater passion the cloud of lament now rising from its source what will her proud soul so hard to check
do when stung by this injury
medea
oh what sufferings are mine sufferings that call for loud lamentation o accursed children of a hateful mother may you perish with your father and the whole house collapse in ruin
nurse
oh woe is me why do you make the children sharers in their fathers sin why do you hate them o children how terrified i am that you may come to harm the minds of royalty are dangerous
since they often command and seldom obey they are subject to violent changes of mood for it is better to be accustomed to live on terms of equality at any rate may i be able to grow old in modest state and with security
for moderate fortune has a name that is fairest on the tongue and in practice it is by far the most beneficial thing for mortals but excessive riches mean no advantage for mortals and when a god is angry at a house
they make the ruin greater
enter by eisodos b a group of corinthian women as chorus
chorus
i have heard the voice i have heard the cry of the unhappy woman of colchis is she not yet soothed tell me old woman
for i heard from a servant of her shouting within the house and it is no joy i feel at this houses misfortunes since i have shared the cup of friendship with it
nurse
the house is no more it has perished
for the husband is held fast in a royal marriage while the wife my mistress wastes away her life in her chamber her heart in no way soothed by the words of any of her friends
medea
oh may a flash of lightning pierce my head
what profit any longer for me in life ah ah may i find my rest in death and leave behind my hateful life
chorus
did you hear o zeus and earth and light of the sun what a wail the miserable
woman utters what is this desire you feel for the bed of death the bed we should not approach foolish woman death will come all too quickly do not pray for it
but if your husband holds another marriagebed in honor do not vex yourself on his account zeus will be your advocate in this do not grieve excessively or weep over your husband
medea
o mighty themis and my lady artemis do you see what i suffer i who have bound my accursed husband with mighty oaths may i one day see him and his new bride ground to destruction and their whole house with them
so terrible are the wrongs they are bold to do me unprovoked o father o my native city from you i departed in shame having killed my brother
nurse
do you hear what she says how she calls on themis invoked in prayer daughter of zeus
who is deemed guardian of mens oaths it is not possible that my mistress will bring her wrath to an end in some trifling deed
chorus
oh how i wish she could come face to face with us and receive the sound
of our words to her on the chance that somehow she might give up her angry temper may my good will never desert my friends
but go now and bring her out of the house tell her that here are friends and hurry before she harms those inside for this grief of hers is charging powerfully forward
nurse
i will do so but there is doubt whether i shall persuade
my mistress still i will make you a further present of my labor though she glowers at the servants with the look of a lioness with cubs when any of them approaches her with something to say
you would be right to call men of old foolish not at all wise for while they invented songs for festivities banquets and dinners and added pleasant sounds to human life
no one discovered how to put an end to mortals bitter griefs with music and song sung to the lyre it is because of these griefs that deaths and terrible disasters overthrow houses it would have been a gain for mortals
to cure these ills by song where there are feasts of plenty why do they raise the loud song to no purpose the abundance of the feast at hand provides mortals with its own pleasureexit nurse into the house
chorus
i have heard her cry full of groans how she utters shrill charges against the husband who betrayed her bed having suffered wrong she raises her cry to zeuss daughter themis goddess of oaths the goddess who brought her
to hellas across the sea through the dark saltwater over the briny gateway of the black sea a gateway few traverse
enter medea with the nurse from the house
medea
medea
women of corinth i have come out of the house
lest you find some fault with me for i know that though many mortals are haughty both in private and in public others get a reputation for indifference to their neighbors from their retiring manner of life there is no justice in mortals eyes
since before they get sure knowledge of a mans true character they hate him on sight although he has done them no harm now a foreigner must be quite compliant with the city nor do i have any words of praise for the citizen who is stubborn and causes his fellowcitizens pain by his lack of breeding
in my case however this sudden blow that has struck me has destroyed my life i am undone i have resigned all joy in life and i want to die for the man in whom all i had was bound up as i well know my husband has proved the basest of men
of all creatures that have breath and sensation we women are the most unfortunate first at an exorbitant price we must buy a husband and master of our bodies this misfortune is more painful than misfortune
and the outcome of our lifes striving hangs on this whether we take a bad or a good husband for divorce is discreditable for women and it is not possible to refuse wedlock and when a woman comes into the new customs and practices of her husbands house she must somehow divine since she has not learned it at home
how she shall best deal with her husband if after we have spent great efforts on these tasks our husbands live with us without resenting the marriageyoke our life is enviable otherwise death is preferable a man whenever he is annoyed with the company of those in the house
goes elsewhere and thus rids his soul of its boredom turning to some male friend or agemate but we must fix our gaze on one person only men say that we live a life free from danger at home while they fight with the spear
how wrong they are i would rather stand three times with a shield in battle than give birth once
but your story and mine are not the same you have a city and a fathers house the enjoyment of life and the company of friends
while i without relatives or city am suffering outrage from my husband i was carried off as booty from a foreign land and have no mother no brother no kinsman to shelter me from this calamity and so i shall ask from you this much as a favor
if i find any means or contrivance to punish my husband for these wrongs and the brides father and the bride keep my secret in all other things a woman is full of fear incapable of looking on battle or cold steel
but when she is injured in love no mind is more murderous than hers
chorusleader
i will do so for you will be right to punish your husband medea and i am not surprised that you grieve at what has happened
enter creon by eisodos b
but i see creon coming ruler of this land
he will have some new deliberation to report
creon
you medea scowling with rage against your husband i order you to leave this land and go into exile taking your two children with you and instantly i am the executor of this decree
and i will not return home again until i expel you from this land
medea
oh i am undone wholly lost my enemies are making full sail against me and there is no haven from disaster that i can reach
still though i am illtreated i will ask you why are you exiling me creon
creon
i am afraid （no need to dissemble） that you will do some deadly harm to my daughter many indications of this combine
you are a clever woman and skilled in many evil arts and you are smarting with the loss of your husbands love and i hear that you are threatening such is the report people bring to harm the bride her father and her husband so i shall take precautions before the event
it is better for me to incur your hatred now woman than to be soft now and regret it later
medea
ah me this is not the first time creon but often before now my reputation has done me great harm no man who is sensible ought ever
to have his children educated beyond the common run for apart from the charge of idleness they incur they earn hostility and illwill from their fellowcitizens if you bring novel wisdom to fools you will be regarded as useless not wise
and if the city regards you as greater than those with a reputation for cleverness you will be thought vexatious i myself am a sharer in this lot for since i am clever in the eyes of some i am an object of illwill others find me retiring others the opposite
others an obstacle yet i am not so very wise while you on the other hand fear me what harm are you afraid of have no fear creon i am not the kind of person to commit crimes against my rulers what injustice have you done me you married your daughter
to the man your heart bade you to it is my husband i hate while you i think acted with perfect good sense in this and now i do not begrudge you prosperity make your marriage all of you and may good fortune attend you but let me stay in this land for although i have been wronged
i will hold my peace yielding to my superiors
creon
your words are soothing to listen to but i am afraid that in your heart you are plotting some harm i trust you that much the less than before a hottempered woman and a hottempered man likewise
is easier to guard against than a clever woman who keeps her own counsel no go into exile at once speak me no speeches since my resolve is fixed and there is no way you can remain in our midst since you are hostile to me
medeamedea kneels before him in the attitude of a suppliant grasping his knees and hand
do not i beg you by your knees and by your newlywedded daughter
creon
you waste your words you will never win me over
medea
but will you banish me without the regard due a suppliant
creon
yes i do not love you more than my own house
medea
o fatherland how i think of you now
creon
yes after my children it is much the dearest thing to me
medea
oh what a bane is love to mortals
creon
i fancy that depends on the circumstances
medea
zeus do not forget who has caused all this woe
creon
go foolish woman and rid me of my trouble
medea
trouble i have already i have no need of more
creon
in a moment you will be thrown out of the country by my servants
medea
no no not that i entreat you creon
creon
woman it seems you are bent on causing me annoyance
medea
i accept my exile it was not exile i sought reprieve of
creon
why then are you still applying force and clinging to my hand
medea
allow me to remain this one day and to complete my plans for exile and to ensure some provision for my children since their father does not care to do so have pity on them you too are a parent
and we might expect you to be welldisposed towards them i do not care if i myself go into exile it is their experience of misfortune i weep for
creon
my nature is not at all a tyrants and by showing consideration i have often suffered loss
and now though i see that i am making a serious mistake nonetheless woman you shall have your request but i warn you if tomorrows sun sees you and your children within the borders of this land you will be put to death i mean what i have said
now stay if stay you must for one more day you will not do the mischief i fear by thenexit creon by eisodos b medea rises to her feet
chorusleader
unhappy woman o dear crushed by your misfortunes where will you turn what protector of strangers will you find
what house what land to save you from calamity  medea a god has cast you into a hopeless sea of troubles
medea
in every way the situation is bad who will deny it
but it is not thus do not imagine it that things will turn out in the end if i have any power in my arts there are still struggles for the newlywedded pair and for the maker of the match difficulties that are not trifling do you think i would ever have fawned on this man unless i stood to gain unless i were plotting
i would not even have spoken to him or touched him with my hands but he has reached such a pitch of folly that while it lay in his power to check my plans by banishing me he has permitted me to stay for this day a day on which i shall make corpses of three of my enemies
the father his daughter and my husband
now since i possess many ways of killing them i do not know which i should try first my friends shall i set the bridal chamber on fire or thrust a sharp sword through their vitals
creeping into the house where the marriagebed is spread one thing however stands in my path if i am caught entering the house and plotting its destruction i will be killed and bring joy to my foes best to proceed by the direct route in which i am
the most skilled and kill them with poison
so be it now let us suppose they have been killed what city will receive me what friend will give me a safe country and a secure house and rescue me there is no one and so i shall wait a short time yet
and if some tower of safety appears i shall go about this murder by stealth but if hard circumstance forces me into the open i shall take the sword and even though i am sure to die for it kill them with my own hand going to the very utmost of daring
by the goddess i worship most of all my chosen helper hecate who dwells in the inner chamber of my house none of them shall pain my heart and smile at it bitter will i make their marriage
bitter creons marriagealliance and bitter my banishment from the land come medea spare nothing of the arts you are mistress of as you plot and contrive into the fray now it is a contest of courage do you see what is being done to you you must not suffer mockery
from this sisyphean marriage of jason you who are sprung from a noble father and have helios for your grandsire but you understand how to proceed and furthermore we are women unable to perform great deeds of valor but most skilful architects of every evil
chorus
backward to their sources flow the streams of holy rivers and the order of all things is reversed mens thoughts have become deceitful and their oaths by the gods do not hold fast
the common talk will so alter that womens ways will enjoy good repute honor is coming to the female sex no more will women be maligned
by slanderous rumor
chorus
the poetry of ancient bards will cease to hymn our faithlessness phoebus lord of song never endowed our minds
with the glorious strains of the lyre else i could have sounded a hymn in reply to the male sex the long expanse of time can say many things of mens lot
as well as of womens
chorus
but you sailed from your fathers halls passing with lovemaddened heart between the twin rocks of the euxine
on strange soil you now dwell you have lost your marriagebed your husbands love poor wretch and you are being driven from this land an exile without rights
chorus
the magical power of an oath has gone and shame is no more
to be found in wide hellas she has taken wing to heaven you have no fathers home in which to find anchorage unhappy woman and another a princess greater match than yourself
holds sway in the house
enter jason by eisodos b
jason
not now for the first time but often before i have seen what an impossible evil to deal with is a fierce temper although you could have kept this land and this house by patiently bearing with your superiors arrangements
you will be exiled because of your foolish talk not that it bothers me go on if you like calling jason the basest man alive but as for your words against the ruling family count yourself lucky that your punishment is exile
for my part i have always tried to soothe the kings angry temper and i wanted you to stay but you would not cease from your folly and always kept reviling the ruling house for that you will be exiled
still even after this i have not failed my loved ones
but have come here in your interests woman so that you might not go into exile with your children penniless or in need of anything exile brings many hardships with it even if you hate me i could never bear you illwill
medea
medea
vilest of knaves for that is the worst insult my tongue can speak against your lack of manly worth have you really come to see me when you have made yourself my worst enemy to the gods to me and to the whole human race this is not boldness or courage
to wrong your loved ones and then look them in the face but the worst of all mortal vices shamelessness but you did well to come for it will relieve my feelings to tell you how wicked you are and you will be stung by what i have to say
i shall begin my speech from the beginning i saved your life as witness all the greeks who went on board the argo with you when you were sent to master the firebreathing bulls with a yoke and to sow the field of death
the dragon who kept watch over the golden fleece sleeplessly guarding it with his sinuous coils i killed and i raised aloft for you the fair light of escape from death of my own accord i abandoned my father and my home and came with you to iolcus under pelion
showing more love than sense i murdered pelias by the most horrible of deaths at the hand of his own daughters and i destroyed his whole house and after such benefits from me o basest of men you have betrayed me and have taken a new marriage
though we had children for if you were still childless your desire for this marriage would be understandable
respect for your oaths is gone and i cannot tell whether you think that the gods of old no longer rule or that new ordinances have now been set up for mortals
since you are surely aware that you have not kept your oath to me o right hand of mine which you often grasped togther with my knees how profitless was the suppliant grasp upon us of a knave and how we have been cheated of our hopes
but come now for i will share my thoughts with you as a friend
（yet what benefit can i expect to get from you still i will do it for you will be shown up in an uglier light by my questions） where am i now to turn to my fathers house which like my country i betrayed for your sake when i came here or to the wretched daughters of pelias a fine
reception they would give me in their house since i killed their father this is how things stand to my own kin i have become an enemy and by my services to you i have made foes of those i need not have harmed that doubtless is why you have made me so happy in the eyes of many greek women
in return for these favors i poor wretch have in you a wonderful and faithful husband if i am to flee the country sent into exile deprived of friends abandoned with my abandoned children this is splendid praise for a new bridegroom
that his children are wandering as beggars and she who saved him likewise
o zeus why when you gave to men sure signs of gold that is counterfeit is there no mark on the human body by which one could identify base men
chorusleader
terrible and hard to heal is the wrath that comes when kin join in conflict with kin
jason
jason
it appears woman that i must be no mean speaker but like the good helmsman of a ship reef my sail up to its hem and run before the storm
of your wearisome prattling since you so exaggerate your kindness to me i for my part think that aphrodite alone of gods and mortals was the savior of my expedition as for you i grant you have a clever mind but to tell
how eros forced you with his ineluctable arrows to save me would expose me to illwill no i will not make too strict a reckoning on this point so far as you did help me you did well but in return for saving me
you got more than you gave as i shall make clear first you now live among greeks and not barbarians and you understand justice and the rule of law with no concession to force all the greeks have learned that you are clever
and you have won renown but if you lived at the worlds edge there would be no talk of you may i have neither gold in my house nor power to sing songs sweeter than orpheus if it is not my lot to have high renown
thus far i have spoken to you regarding my labors for it was you who started this contest of words as for your reproaches to me against my royal marriage here i shall show first that i am wise second selfcontrolled and third a great friend to you
and my childrenmedea makes a gesture of impatience
no hold your peace when i first moved here from the land of iolcus bringing with me many misfortunes hard to deal with what luckier find than this could i have made marriage with the daughter of the king though i was an exile
it was not the point that seems to irk you that i was weary of your bed and smitten with desire for a new bride nor was i eager to rival others in the number of my children （we have enough already and i make no complaint） but my purpose was that we should live well which is the main thing
and not be in want knowing that everyone goes out of his way to avoid a penniless friend i wanted to raise the children in a manner befitting my house to beget brothers to the children born from you and put them on the same footing with them so that by drawing the family into one
i might prosper for your part what need have you of any more children for me it is advantageous to use future children to benefit those already born was this a bad plan not even you would say so if you were not galled by the matter of sex but you women are so far gone in folly that if all is well
in bed you think you have everything while if some misfortune in that domain occurs you regard as hateful your best and truest interests mortals ought you know to beget children from some other source and there should be no female sex
then mankind would have no trouble
chorusleader
jason you have marshalled your arguments very skilfully but i think even though it may be imprudent to say so that in abandoning your wife you are not doing right
medea
i realize i have far different views from the majority of mortals
to my mind the plausible speaker who is a scoundrel incurs the greatest punishment for since he is confident that he can cleverly cloak injustice with his words his boldness stops at no knavery yet he is not as wise as all that so it is with you do not therefore give me your specious arguments
and oratory for one word will lay you out if you were not a knave you ought to have gained my consent before making this marriage not done it behind your familys back
jason
fine support i think would you have given to my proposal if i had mentioned the marriage to you seeing that even now
you cannot bring yourself to lay aside the towering rage in your heart
medea
it was not this you thought that in later years a barbarian wife would discredit you
jason
you may be quite sure of this that it was not for the sake of a woman that i married the royal bride i now have
but as i have just said because i wanted to save you and to beget princes as brothers to my children to be a bulwark for the house
medea
a prosperous life that causes pain is no wish of mine nor do i want any wealth that torments my heart
jason
do you know how to change your prayer and show yourself the wiser pray that you may never consider advantage as painful nor think yourself wretched when you are fortunate
medea
go on insult me you have a refuge but i go friendless into exile
jason
you yourself chose that you have no one else to blame
medea
how by taking another wife and abandoning you
jason
by uttering unholy curses against the royal family
medea
yes and i am a curse to your house too
jason
i shall not argue any more of this case with you
but if you wish to get some of my money to help the children and yourself in exile say the word for i am ready to give with unstinting hand and also to send tokens to my friends who will treat you well
you would be a fool not to accept this offer woman forget your anger and it will be the better for you
medea
i will accept no help from your friends nor will i take anything from you so do not offer it the gifts of a base man bring no benefit
jason
at any rate i call the gods to witness
that i am willing to help you and the children all i can but you refuse good treatment and obstinately rebuff your friends this will only make your pain the greaterexit jason by eisodos b
medea
go it is clear that you are seized by longing for your new bride as you linger so long out of the palace
go play the bridegroom for perhaps and this will prove to be prophetic you will make such a marriage as to cause you to weep
chorus
loves that come to us in excess bring no good name or goodness to men
if aphrodite comes in moderation no other goddess brings such happiness never o goddess may you smear with desire one of your ineluctable arrows and let it fly against my heart
from your golden bow
chorus
may moderation attend me fairest gift of the gods may aphrodite never cast contentious wrath and insatiate quarreling upon me and
madden my heart with love for a strangers bed but may she honor marriages that are peaceful and wisely determine whom we are to wed
chorus
o fatherland o house may i never be bereft of my city never have a life of helplessness a cruel life most pitiable of woes
in death o in death may i be brought low ere that ending the light of my life of troubles none is greater than to be robbed of ones native land
chorus
we ourselves have seen it and it is not from others
report that i can tell this tale for no city no friend has taken pity on you who have suffered the most grievous of sufferings may that man die unloved who cannot
honor his friends unlocking to them his honest mind to me at any rate he shall never be friend
enter by eisodos a aegeus the aged king of athens in travelling costume
aegeus
medea i wish you joy no one knows a better way than this to address a friend
medea
joy to you as well aegeus son of wise pandion where have you come from to be visiting the soil of this land
aegeus
i have come from the ancient oracle of phoebus
medea
why did you go to earths prophetic center
aegeus
to inquire how i might get offspring
medea
have you really lived so long a life without children
aegeus
i am childless it is the act of some god
medea
have you a wife or have you no experience of marriage
aegeus
i am not without a wife to share my bed
medea
what then did phoebus tell you about children
aegeus
words too wise for mortal to interpret
medea
is it lawful for me to hear the response
aegeus
most certainly it calls for a wise mind
medea
what then did the god say tell me if it is lawful to hear
aegeus
‘do not the wineskins salient foot untie
medea
until you do what or come to what country
aegeus
until you come to hearth and home again’
medea
and what were you in need of that you sailed to this land
aegeus
there is a man named pittheus king of trozen
medea
the son of pelops and a man most pious they say
aegeus
it is with him that i wish to share the gods response
medea
the man is wise and experienced in such matters
aegeus
what is more he is closest of all my allies
medea
well good luck attend you and may you obtain what you desire
aegeus
noticing medeas distraught demeanor
but why is your face dissolved in tears
medea
aegeus my husband is the basest of men
aegeus
what is this you say tell me particulars of your unhappiness
medea
jason wrongs me though he has suffered no wrong from me
aegeus
what has he done tell me in detail
medea
he has put another woman over me as mistress of the house
aegeus
surely he has not dared such a shameful act
medea
he has indeed once he loved me but now i am cast off
aegeus
was it some passion or did he grow tired of your bed
medea
a great passion he has been unfaithful to his family
aegeus
pay him no mind then since as you say he is base
medea
his passion was to marry a kings daughter
aegeus
who has given his daughter to him tell me the rest
medea
creon who rules this land of corinth
aegeus
but it is quite understandable then that you are distressed
medea
i am finished furthermore i am being exiled from the country
aegeus
by whom this is yet another misfortune you speak of
medea
it is creon who exiles me from corinth
aegeus
does jason accede to this i do not approve of that either
medea
he pretends not to but he is ready to put up with it
medea kneels before aegeus in the posture of a suppliant
but i beg you by your beard
and by your knees and i make myself your suppliant have pity have pity on an unfortunate woman and do not allow me to be cast into exile without a friend but receive me into your land and your house as a suppliant if you do so may your longing for children
be brought to fulfillment by the gods and may you yourself die happy you do not know what a lucky find you have made in me i will put an end to your childlessness and cause you to beget children for i know the medicines to do it
aegeus
dear woman for many reasons
i am eager to grant you this favor first for the sake of the gods then for the children you promise i will beget for on that score i am utterly undone but here is how matters stand with me if you come to my country i shall in justice try to act as your protector
this much however i tell you in advance i will not consent to take you from this land but if you manage by yourself to come to my house you may stay there in safety and i will never give you up to anyone you must go on your own then from this land
i wish to be blameless in the eyes of my hosts as well
medea
it shall be so but if you were to give me a promise of this i would have all i could wish from you
aegeus
do you not trust me what is your difficulty
medea
i trust you but pelias house is hostile to me
and creon as well if you are bound by an oath you will not give me up to them when they come to take me out of the country but if you have made an agreement in mere words and have not sworn by the gods you might become their friend and comply with diplomatic requests for i am weak
while they have wealth and royal power
aegeus
you have shown much prudence in your speech well if you like i do not object to doing this not only is this plan safer for me since i can show your enemies some pretext
but your own case is more secure name the gods i must swear by
medea
swear by the plain of earth by helios my grandfather and by the whole race of gods all together
aegeus
to do what or to refrain from what you must say
medea
that you yourself will never banish me from your land
and that if any of my enemies ask to take me you will not willingly give me up as long as you live
aegeus
i swear by earth by the holy light of helios and by all the gods that i will do as i have heard from your lips
medea
that is good but what punishment do you call down on yourself if you do not abide by your oath
aegeus
the punishment that befalls the impious among mortals
medea
go your way with joy for all is well and i shall come to your city as soon as i can when i have accomplished what i intend and gained what i wishexit aegeus by eisodos a
chorusleader
may hermes maias son patron of travellers
bring you safely to your house and may you accomplish what you have set your heart on aegeus since in my eyes you are a generous man
medea
medea
o zeus and zeuss justice o light of the sun
now my friends i shall be victorious over my enemies i have set my foot on the path now i may confidently expect that my enemies will pay the penalty for this man at the very point where i was most in trouble has appeared as a harbor for my plans
to him will i tie my cable when i go to the city of pallas athena
now i shall tell you all of my designs hear then words that will give you no pleasure i shall send one of my servants and ask
jason to come to see me when he arrives i shall speak soothing words to him saying that i hold the same opinion as he that the royal marriage he has made by abandoning me is well made that these are beneficial and good decisions
i shall ask that the children be allowed to stay not with the thought that i might leave my children behind on hostile soil for my enemies to insult but so that i may kill the princess by guile i shall send them bearing gifts
bearing them to the bride so as not to be exiled a finelywoven gown and a diadem of beaten gold if she takes this finery and puts it on she will die a painful death and likewise anyone who touches her with such poisons will i smear these gifts
this subject however i now leave behind ah me i groan at what a deed i must do next i shall kill my children there is no one who can rescue them
when i have utterly confounded the whole house of jason i shall leave the land in flight from the murder of my own dear sons having committed a most unholy deed the laughter of ones enemies is unendurable my friends let that be as it will what do i gain by living i have no fatherland no house and no means to turn aside misfortune
my mistake was when i left my fathers house persuaded by the words of a greek this man a god being my helper will pay the price of his deeds to me he shall never from this day see his children by me alive nor will he beget children
by his new bride since that wretch must die a wretched death by my poisons let no one think me weak contemptible untroublesome no quite the opposite hurtful to foes to friends kindly
such persons live a life of greatest glory
chorusleader
since you have shared this plan with me and since i wish to help you and uphold the laws of society i urge you not to do this deed
medea
it cannot be otherwise i excuse you for speaking
thus since you have not suffered as i have
chorusleader
yet will you bring yourself to kill your own offspring woman
medea
it is the way to hurt my husband most
chorusleader
and for yourself to become the most wretched of women
medea
be that as it may till then all talk is superfluous to the nurse
but you go and fetch jason （for i use your service on all errands of trust） tell him nothing of my intentions if you are loyal to your mistress and a womanexit nurse by eisodos b medea into the house
chorus
from ancient times the sons of erechtheus have been favored
they are children of the blessed gods sprung from a holy land never pillaged by the enemy they feed on wisdom most glorious always stepping gracefully
through the bright air where once they say the nine pierian muses gave birth to fairhaired harmonia
chorus
legend tells that aphrodite filling her pail at the streams of the cephisus blew down upon the land temperate
and sweetly blowing breezes and ever dressing her hair with a fragrant chaplet of roses she sends the loves to sit at wisdoms side
joint workers in every kind of excellence
chorus
how then shall this city of holy rivers or this land that walks at the side of gods lodge you the killer of your children stained with their blood
in the company of her citizens think on the slaying of your children think what slaughter you are committing do not we beseech you by your knees and in every way we can
do not kill your children
chorus
how will you summon up the strength of purpose or the courage of hand and heart to dare this dreadful deed
when you have turned your eyes upon your children how will you behold their fate with tearless eye when your children fall as suppliants at your feet you will not be able to drench your hand in their blood
with hardened heart
enter medea from the house then jason by eisodos b accompanied by the nurse
jason
i have come at your bidding for though you hate me you will not fail to obtain a hearing from me what further do you wish from me woman
medea
jason i beg you to forgive
what i said it is reasonable for you to put up with my anger since many acts of love have passed between us in the past i have talked with myself and reproached myself thus ‘foolish creature why am i raving and fighting those who plan things for the best
why am i making myself an enemy to the rulers of this land and to my husband who is acting in my interests by marrying a princess and begetting brothers for my children shall i not cease from my wrath （what has come over me） when the gods are being so kind
do i not have the children is it not true that we are exiles and in need of friends’ these reflections have made me realize that i was being very foolish and was being angry for nothing so now i approve and i agree that you are acting with sober sense
by contracting this marriagealliance for us it is i who am the fool since i ought to be sharing in your plans helping you carry them out standing by the marriagebed and taking joy in the match i was making with your bride but we women are i will not say bad creatures
but we are what we are so you ought not to imitate our nature or return our childishness with childishness i give in i admit that i was foolish then but now i have taken a better view of the matter children children come here leave the house
come out
the children enter from the house with the tutor
greet your father speak to him with me and join your mother in making an end to our former hostility against one dear to us we have made a truce and our wrath has vanished take his right hand ah how i think
of something the future keeps hid my children will you continue all your lives long to stretch out your dear hands so unhappy me how prone to tears i am how full of foreboding and as i now at long last make up the quarrel with your father
my tender eyes are filled with tears
chorusleader
darkly
from my eyes too a pale tear starts may misfortune go no further than it has
jason
i approve this woman nor do i blame your earlier resentment for it is natural for a woman to get angry
when a marriage of a different sort presents itself to the husband but your thoughts have changed for the better and though it took time you have recognized the superior plan these are the acts of a prudent woman children your father has given anxious thought
and has secured for you with the gods help abundant prosperity i think that some day with your new brothers you will hold the very first place in the land of corinth but grow to manhood the rest your father will see to with the help of whatever god it is that smiles on him
may i see you as fine strapping lads coming to young manhood victorious over my enemies
medea turns away weeping
you there why do you dampen your eyes with pale tears and turn your white cheek away and why are you not pleased to hear these words from me
medea
it is nothing i was thinking about the children
jason
but why poor soul do you lament over these children
medea
i gave them birth and when you prayed that they might live i felt pity for them wondering whether this would be
jason
have no fear i shall take good care of that
medea
i shall do so i will not distrust your words but a woman is by nature female and prone to tears
but of the reasons for our conversation some have been spoken of others i shall mention now the rulers of this land have resolved to exile me
and it is all for the best for me i am well aware that i not stay where i am in your way or that of the countrys rulers for i am thought to be an enemy to this house therefore i for my part shall leave this land in exile but in order that the children may be raised by you
beg creon that they not be sent into exile
jason
i dont know whether i shall win him over but i must try
medea
well then tell your wife to ask her father that the children not be exiled
jason
most certainly and i think i shall persuade her
medea
yes if she is a woman like the rest but i too shall lend a hand in this i shall send her gifts gifts i know well are more beautiful by far than any now among mortals a finelywoven gown and a diadem of beaten gold
by the hand of my children to her servants  one of you servants quick bring the raiment out to me
one of the servants goes into the house
to jason she will have not one happiness but countless getting in you an excellent husband to share her bed and possessing raiment which my grandfather
helios gave to his descendants
the servant returns with the gifts
take this bridal dowry children into your hands take and give it to the happy royal bride it will be no contemptible gift she receives
jason
silly woman why do you deprive yourself of these things
do you think the royal house has need of gowns or gold keep them dont give them away for if my wife holds me in any regard she will value my wishes more highly than wealth i am quite sure
medea
not a word they say gifts win over even the gods
and gold is more to mortals than ten thousand words her star is on the rise heaven is enhancing her lot she is young and on the throne and to free my children from exile i would give my life not merely gold
now children when you have entered the rich palace
entreat your fathers new wife my mistress and beg her that you not be exiled and give her the raiment this is the most important thing that she receive the gifts into her hands go with all speed and may you have success
and bring back to your mother the good news she longs to hearexit jason and children accompanied by the tutor and the nurse by eisodos b
chorus
now no more can i hope that the children shall live no more for already they are walking the road to murder the bride will accept will accept unhappy woman ruin in the form of a golden diadem
about her fair hair with her own hand she will place the finery of death
chorus
their charm and heavenly gleam will entice her to put on the gown and the circlet of fashioned gold
but the bridal bed she lies in will be among the dead such is the snare such the death she will fall into she will not escape destruction
chorus
and you unlucky bridegroom married into the house of kings all unwitting you bring destruction upon your childrens life and upon your wife a dreadful death
unhappy man how wrong you were about your destiny
chorus
your sorrows next i mourn unhappy mother of the children who mean to kill your sons because of your marriagebed
your husband wickedly abandoned it and now lives with another as his wife
enter the tutor with the children by eisodos b
tutor
my lady your sons here have been reprieved from exile and the princess has been pleased to take the gifts into her hands from that quarter the children have peace
medea turns away and weeps
ah
why are you standing in distress when your fortune is good why have you turned your face away and why do you show no pleasure at this news
medea
alas
tutor
this is not in tune with my tidings
medea
alas once more
tutor
do i in ignorance report some mishap
and wrongly think my news is good
medea
you have reported what you have reported i find no fault with you
tutor
why then is your face downcast why do you weep
medea
i have every reason old man the gods and i in my madness have contrived it so
tutor

medea
before that there are others i shall bring home wretch that i am
tutor
you are not the only woman to be separated from her children we mortals must bear misfortune with resignation
medea
medea
i will do so but go into the house
and provide the children with their daily needs
exit tutor into the house
my children my children you have a city and a home in which leaving your poor mother behind you will live henceforth bereft of me but i shall go to another land as an exile
before i have the enjoyment of you and see you happy before i have tended to your baths and wives and marriagebeds and held the weddingtorches aloft how wretched my selfwill has made me it was all in vain i see that i brought you up
all in vain that i labored and was wracked with toils enduring harsh pains in childbirth truly many were the hopes that i poor fool once had in you that you would tend me in my old age and when i died dress me for burial with your own hands
an enviable fate for mortals but now this sweet imagining has perished for bereft of you i shall live out my life in pain and grief and you will no longer see your mother with loving eyes but pass into another manner of life
oh what is the meaning of your glance at me children why do you smile at me this last smile of yours alas what am i to do my courage is gone women ever since i saw the bright faces of the children i cannot do it farewell my former
designs i shall take my children out of the land why should i wound their father with their pain and win for myself pain twice as great i shall not farewell my designs
but what is coming over me do i wish to suffer mockery
letting my enemies go unpunished must i put up with that no it is mere weakness in me even to admit such tender words into my heart children go into the house whoever is not permitted to attend my sacrifice
shall feel concern for them i shall not weaken my hand oh do not my angry heart do not do these things let them go hardhearted wretch spare the children if they live with me in that other place they will gladden you by hells avenging furies
i shall never leave my children for my enemies to outrage they must die in any case and since they must the one who gave them birth shall kill them these things are settled in any case and cannot be undone
the children begin to move toward the house
already the crown is on her head and the royal bride is perishing in the robe i know it well but since i now go down the road of greatest misery and send these down one unhappier yet i want to say farewell to the children
the children return to medea
give me
your right hands to kiss my children give them to me o hands and lips so dear to me o noble face and bearing of my children i wish you happiness but in that other place what is here your father has taken away oh how sweet is the touch
how tender the skin how fragrant the breath of these children go in go in i can no longer look at you but am overwhelmed with my pain and i know well what pain i am about to undergo but my wrath overbears my calculation
wrath that brings mortal men their gravest hurtexit the children into the house followed by medea
chorusleader
often ere now i have engaged in discourses subtler and entered upon contests greater than is right for woman to peer into
no we too possess a muse who consorts with us to bring us wisdom not with all of us for it is some small clan one woman among many that you will find with a share in the muse
i say that those mortals who are utterly without experience of children and have never borne them have the advantage in good fortune over those who have for the childless because they do not possess children
and do not know whether they are a pleasure or a vexation to mortals hold themselves aloof from many griefs but those who have in their house the sweet gift of children them i see
worn down their whole life with care first how they shall raise their children well and how they may leave them some livelihood and after that it is unclear whether all their toil is expended on worthless or worthy objects
but the last of all misfortunes for all mortals i shall now mention suppose they have found a sufficient livelihood suppose the childrens bodies have arrived at young manhood and their character is good yet if their destiny
so chances off goes death carrying the childrens bodies to hades how then does it profit us that for the sake of heirs the gods cast upon mortals in addition to their other troubles
this further grief most painful
enter medea from the house

can you commit an outrage against the royal house and then rejoice at the news and not be afraid

twice the pleasure if they died in agony
messenger
messenger
when your two children came with their father and entered the brides house all of us servants who were troubled by your misfortunes were cheered for our ears buzzed with the loud report
that you and your husband had brought your former quarrel to an end and someone kissed the hands and another the blond heads of the children and i myself for very joy went along with the children into the womens quarters here the mistress we now honor instead of you
before she saw the two children had eyes only for jason then she veiled her eyes and turned her white cheek away disgusted at seeing the children come in but your husband
tried to take away the girls wrathful mood and said ‘you must not be unkind to your kin but must cease your anger and turn your face towards us again regarding those as near and dear your husband so regards receive these gifts and ask your father
to grant these children release from their exile for my sake’
when she had seen the raiment she could not wait but consented to all her husband asked and before your children and their father had gone far from the house she took the manycolored gown and put it on
and setting the gold crown about her locks she arranged her hair in a bright mirror smiling at the lifeless image of her body and then getting up from her seat she paraded about the room her white feet making dainty steps
entranced with the gifts glancing back again and again at the straight tendon of her leg but thereafter there was a terrible sight to behold for her color changed and with legs trembling she staggered back sidelong and by falling on the chair
barely escaped collapsing on the floor and one old woman among the servants thinking i suppose that a frenzy from pan or one of the other gods had come upon her raised a festal shout to the god until she saw the white foam coming between her lips and her eyes
starting out of their sockets and her skin all pale and bloodless then indeed she raised a wail in answer to her former shout and at once one servant went to her fathers house another to her new husband to tell of the brides misfortune the whole
house rang with the sound of drumming footsteps
and by now a sprinter putting his legs in swift motion would be reaching the finishline of the twohundredyard course when the poor woman wakened from her silence opened her eyes and gave forth a terrible groan
for she was being attacked with a double pain the golden circlet about her head shot forth a terrible stream of consuming fire and the finespun gown gift of your sons was eating into the wretched girls white flesh
and all aflame she leapt from the chair and fled tossing her hair this way and that trying to shake off the diadem but the gold crown held its fastenings firmly and when she shook her hair the fire only blazed up twice as high
she fell to the floor overwhelmed by disaster barely recognizable to any but her father her eyes no longer kept their wonted form nor did her shapely face and from the top of her head blood dripped mingled with fire
and her flesh dropped from her bones like resin from a pinetorch torn by the unseen jaws of the poison a dreadful sight to behold and we were all afraid to touch the corpse taught well by the event we had seen
but her poor father ignorant of the calamity
stumbled upon her body unprepared as he entered the chamber and at once he groaned aloud and throwing his arms about her kissed her and said ‘o unhappy child which of the gods has destroyed you so shamefully and has bereft me of you me an old man
at deaths door oh may i die with you my child’ but when he had ceased from his wailing and lamenting and wished to raise up his aged body to his feet he stuck fast to the finespun dress as ivy clings to laurelshoots and a terrible wrestling ensued
for he wanted to rise to his knees but she held him fast and prevented him and if he used force he would rip his aged flesh from his bones finally the poor man gave up and breathed his last for he could not overcome the calamity
they lie dead the daughter and her old father nearby a disaster that calls for tears
as regards your fate i will say nothing you will know soon enough the punishment that will visit you as for our mortal life this is not the first time that i have thought it to be a shadow
and i would say without any fear that those mortals who seem to be clever and workersup of polished speeches are guilty of the greatest folly for no mortal ever attains to blessedness one may may be luckier than another
when wealth flows his way but blessed neverexit messenger by eisodos b

plagued by spirits of vengeance

you women who stand near the house is medea inside she who has done these dreadful deeds
or has she fled she will have to hide herself beneath the earth or soar aloft to heaven if she is not going to give satisfaction to the royal house does she think that having killed this lands ruling family
she will escape from this house unscathed
but it is not so much about her that i am concerned as about the children she will be punished by those she has wronged but i have come to save my childrens life that no harm may come to them from the next of kin
avenging on them their mothers impious crime
chorusleader
poor jason you have no idea how far gone you are in misfortune else you would not have spoken these words
jason
what is it  surely she does not mean to kill me as well
chorusleader
your children are dead killed by their mothers hand
jason
what can you mean you have destroyed me woman
chorusleader
you must realize that your children are no more

where did she kill them in the house or outside
chorusleader
open the gates and you will see your slaughtered sons

servants remove the bar at once
so that i may see a double disaster these childrens corpses and her who did the deed so that for these childrens murder i may exact punishment
jason tries to open the doors of the house medea appears aloft in a winged chariot upon the mechane which rises from behind the skene
medea
why do you rattle these gates and try to unbar them in search of the corpses and me who did the deed cease your toil if you need anything from me
speak if you like but your hand can never touch me such is the chariot helios my grandfather has given me to ward off a hostile hand
jason
o detestable creature utterly hateful to the gods to me and to the whole human race
you brought yourself to take the sword to your own children and destroyed my life with childlessness and having done this can you look on the sun and the earth when you are guilty of a most abominable deed death and ruin seize you now i am in my right mind though i was insane before
when i brought you from your home among the barbarians to a greek house a great curse you were even then betrayer of father and of the land that nourished you but the avenging spirit meant for you the gods have visited on me for you killed your own brother at the hearth
and then stepped aboard the fairprowed argo it was with acts like these that you began but now when you were married to me and had borne me children you killed them because of sex and the marriagebed no greek woman
would have dared to do this yet i married you in preference to them and a hateful and destructive match it has proved you are a shelion not a woman with a nature more savage than scylla the tuscan monster but since ten thousand insults of mine would fail
to sting you such is your native impudence be gone doer of disgraceful deeds and murderer of your children mine is a fate to bewail i shall never have the benefit of my new bride nor will i be able to speak to my children alive
the children i begot and raised but have lost them
medea
long would have been the speech i had made in reply to these words of yours if father zeus did not know clearly what kind of treatment you have had from me and how you have repaid it you were not going to cast aside my bed
and then spend a pleasant life laughing at me no nor the princess either nor was creon who offered you his daughter going to exile me with impunity call me a shelion then if you like and scylla dweller on the tuscan cliff
for i have touched your heart in the vital spot
jason
yes and you also have grief and are a sharer in my misfortune
medea
of course but the pain is worthwhile if you cannot mock me
jason
children what an evil mother you got
medea
children how you have perished by your fathers fault
jason
it was not my hand you know that killed them
medea
no it was the outrage of your new marriage
jason
did you really think it right to kill them because of a marriage
medea
do you imagine that loss of love is a trivial grief for a woman
jason
for a woman of sense yes but you find everything a disaster
medea
but the children are dead this will wound you to the quick
jason
they live alas as spirits to take vengeance on your crimes
medea
the gods know who struck the first blow
jason
yes they know indeed your loathesome heart
medea
hate on i detest the hateful sound of your voice
jason
and i of yours to part will be easy
medea
how what shall i do for that is very much my wish as well
jason
allow me to bury these dead children and to mourn them
medea
certainly not i shall bury them with my own hand taking them to the sanctuary of hera akraia
so that none of my enemies may outrage them by tearing up their graves and i shall enjoin on this land of sisyphus a solemn festival and holy rites for all time to come in payment for this unholy murder as for myself i shall go to the land of erechtheus
to live with aegeus son of pandion but you as is fitting shall die the miserable death of a coward struck on the head by a piece of the argo having seen the bitter result of your marriage to me
jason
may the fury that punishes your childrens death and
justice the murderous destroy you utterly

what god or power above will listen to you who broke your oath and deceived a stranger

to enfold them in my arms
