before the palace of oedipus in thebes  suppliants of all ages are seated on the steps of the altars  oedipus enters in the robes of a king for a moment he gazes silently on the groups at the altars then speaks
oedipus
my children latestborn wards of old cadmus why do you sit before me like this with wreathed branches of suppliants while the city reeks with incense
rings with prayers for health and cries of woe  i thought it unbefitting my children to hear these things from the mouths of others and have come here myself i oedipus renowned by all  tell me then venerable old man since it is proper that you
speak for these in what mood you sit here one of fear or of desire  be sure that i will gladly give you all my help  i would be hardhearted indeed if i did not pity such suppliants as these
priest of zeus
oedipus ruler of my land you see the age of those who sit
on your altars some nestlings still too tender for flight others bowed with age priests like me of zeus and some these here the chosen youth  the rest of the folk sit
with wreathed branches in the marketplace and before the shrines of pallas and where ismenus gives answer by fire  for the city as you yourself see is now sorely vexed and can no longer lift her head from beneath the angry waves of death
a blight has fallen on the fruitful blossoms of the land the herds among the pastures the barren pangs of women  and the flaming god the malign plague has swooped upon us and ravages the town he lays waste to the house of cadmus but enriches hades with
groans and tears  it is not because we rank you with the gods that i and these children are suppliants at your hearth but because we deem you the first among men in lifes common fortunes and in dealings with the divinities
when you came to the city of the cadmeans you freed us from the tax that we rendered to the hard songstress and that when you knew no more than anyone else nor had you been taught but rather by the assistance of a god as the story goes you uplifted our life
now oedipus king glorious in our eyes we your suppliants beseech you to find some defence for us whether you hear it from some divine omen or learn of it from some mortal  for i see that the outcome of the councils of experienced men
most often have effect  on best of mortals uplift our state on guard your fame since now this land calls you savior on account of your former zeal  let us not remember of your reign that
we were first restored and then cast down lift this state so that it falls no more  with good omen you provided us that past happiness show yourself the same now too since if you are to rule this land just as you do now it is better to be lord of men than of a wasteland
neither walled town nor ship is anything if it is empty and no men dwell within
oedipus
my piteous children i know quite well the desires with which you have come i know well that
you all are sick and though you are sick i know well that there is not one of you who is as sick as i  your pain comes on each of you for himself alone and for no other but my soul is in pain at once for the city for myself and for you
thus you are not awakening me from sleep no be sure that i have wept many tears wandered far and wide in my thought  i have made use of the only remedy which i could find after close consideration i sent my relative
creon menoeceus son to apollos pythian residence to learn what we might do or say to protect this city  and now when the lapse of days is reckoned i am troubled about what he is doing for he has been away an unreasonably long time
beyond what is fitting  but when he arrives i would be no true man if did not perform all that the god reveals
priest
you have spoken opportunely since at this time these people here indicate that creon is drawing near
oedipus
lord apollo may he come to us in the brightness of saving fortune even as his face is bright
priest
he seems to bring comfort since otherwise he would not be coming crowned so thickly with berryladen bay
oedipus
we will soon know he is within hearingrange
to creon
prince my kinsman child of menoeceus what news have you brought us from the god
creon
good news  i tell you that even troubles hard to bear will end in perfect peace if they  find the right issue
oedipus
but what is the oracle   so far your words
neither encourage nor frighten me
creon
if you want to hear in the presence of these people i am ready to speak otherwise we can go inside
oedipus
speak to all  the sorrow that i bear for these is more than for my own life
creon
i will tell you what i heard from the god
phoebus our lord clearly commands us to drive out the defilement which he said was harbored in this land and not to nourish it so that it cannot be healed
oedipus
with what sort of purification what is the manner of the misfortune
creon
by banishing the man or by paying back bloodshed with bloodshed since it is this blood which brings the tempest on our city
oedipus
and who is the man whose fate he thus reveals
creon
laius my lord was the leader of our land before you assumed control of this state
oedipus
i know it well by hearsay for i never saw him
creon
he was slain and the god now bids us to take vengeance on his murderers whoever they are
oedipus
where on earth are they where shall the dim track of this old crime be found
creon
in this land the god said  what is sought for can be caught only that which is not watched escapes
oedipus
was it in the house or in the field or on foreign soil that laius met his bloody end
creon
he left our land as he said on a mission to delphi
and once he had set forth he never again returned
oedipus
and was there none to tell was there no travelling companion who saw the deed from whom tidings might have been gained and used
creon
all perished save one who fled in fear and he could tell with assurance only one thing of all that he saw
oedipus
and what was that  one thing might hold the clue to many if we could only get a small beginning for hope
creon
he said that robbers fell upon them not one man alone but with a great force
oedipus
how then unless some intrigue had been worked with bribes
from here in thebes would the robbers have been so bold
creon
such things were surmised  but once laius was slain no avenger arose in the midst of our troubles
oedipus
but when royalty had fallen in this way what trouble prevented a full search
creon
the riddling sphinx had forced us to let things that were obscure go and to investigate the pressing trouble
oedipus
i will start afresh and once more make dark things plain   worthily has phoebus apollo and worthily have you bestowed this care on behalf of the dead  and so as is fitting you will find me allied with you
in seeking vengeance for this land and for the god as well  i will dispel this taint not on behalf of faroff friends but for my own benefit  for whoever killed laius
might wish to take vengeance on me also with a hand as fierce  avenging laius therefore i serve myself  come my children as quickly as possible rise from the altarsteps and lift these suppliant boughs  let someone summon here cadmus people warning them that i will leave nothing untried
for with the gods help our good fortune or our ruin will be made certain
priest
my children let us rise  what we came to seek this man promises of his own accord  and may phoebus who sent these oracles
come to us as savior and deliverer from the pestilence
the chorus of theban elders enters
chorus
o sweetlyspeaking  message of zeus in what spirit have you come to glorious thebes from golden pytho  i am on the rack terror shakes my soul  o delian healer to whom wild cries rise
in holy fear of you wondering what debt you will extract from me perhaps unknown before perhaps renewed with the revolving years  tell me immortal voice child of golden hope
chorusfirst i call on you daughter of zeus immortal athena
and on your sister artemis guardian of our earth who sits on her glorious throne above the circle of our marketplace and on farshooting apollo oh shine forth for me my threefold help against death
if ever before you drove a fiery pest from our borders to stop ruin rushing upon our city come now also
chorusalas countless are the sorrows i bear
a plague is on all our people and thought can find no weapon for defense  the fruits of the glorious earth do not grow by no birth of offspring do women surmount the pangs in which they shriek
you can see life after life speed away like a bird on the wing swifter than irresistible fire to the shore of the western god
choruswith such deaths past numbering the city perishes
unpitied her children lie on the ground spreading pestilence with no one to mourn them  meanwhile young wives and greyhaired mothers raise a wail at the steps of the altars some here some there
and groan in supplication for their terrible woes  the prayers to the healer ring clear and with them the voice of lamentation  for which things golden daughter of zeus send us the bright face of comfort
chorus
grant that the fierce god of death who now without the bronze of shields though among cries like those of battle wraps me in the flames of his onset may turn his back in speedy flight from our land borne by a favorable wind to the great chamber of amphitrite
or to the thracian waves those waters where none find haven  for if night leaves anything undone in the working of destruction day follows to accomplish it  you who wield the
powers of fiery lightning zeus our father slay him beneath your thunderbolt
choruslycean lord would that the shafts from your bent bows string of woven gold might
go forth in their might our champions in the face of the foe and the flashing fires of artemis too with which she darts through the lycian hills  i call him whose locks are bound with gold
who is named with the name of this land ruddy bacchus to whom bacchants cry to draw near with the blaze of his shining torch
our ally against the god unhonored among the gods
oedipus
oedipus
you pray  and in answer to your prayer if you will give a loyal reception to my words and minister to your own disease you may hope to find help and relief from woes  these words i will speak publicly as one who was a stranger to the report
a stranger to the deed  i would not go far on the trail if i were tracing it alone without a clue  but as it is since it was only after the event that i was counted a theban among thebans to you cadmeans all i do thus proclaim
whoever knows
by whom laius son of labdacus was slain i order him to declare all to me  and if he is afraid i order him to remove the danger of indictment from his path by denouncing himself he will suffer no other punishment but will only leave this land unhurt
if anyone knows the assassin to be an alien from another land let him not keep silent  i will reward him and my thanks shall rest with him besides  but if he keeps silent if anyone through fear seeks to screen himself or a friend from my orders
then hear what i shall do  i charge you that no resident of this land which i rule give shelter to or address that murderer whoever he is or make him a partner in prayer or sacrifice
or give him a share of the lustral rite  ban him from your houses all of you knowing that this is the defilement as the oracle of the pythian god has recently shown to me  in this way
i am an ally both to the god and to the dead man  and i pray solemnly that the slayer whoever he is whether he alone is guilty or he has partners may in the horrible way he deserves wear out his unblest life and for myself i pray that if he should
with my knowledge become a resident of my house i may suffer the same things which i have just called down on others  and i order you to make all these words good for my sake for the sake of the god and for the sake of our land thus rendered unfruitful and ungodly
for even if the matter had not been urged upon us by a god
it still would not have been fit that you should leave the guilt unpunished as it is when one so noble and he your king had perished  you should have searched it out  but now since i hold the powers which he once held
possessing his bed and the wife who bore his children and since had his hope of offspring not been unsuccessful children born of one mother would have tied us with a common bond as it was fate swooped upon his head i will uphold this cause as though it were that of my own father
and will leave no stone unturned in my search for the one who shed the blood for the honor of the son of labdacus and of polydorus and the elder cadmus and agenor of old
and for those who do not obey me i pray that the gods
send them neither harvest of the earth nor fruit of the womb but that they perish with the present fate or one still worse  but to all you the loyal cadmeans who are satisfied by these things may justice our ally
and all the gods be gracious always
chorus
as you have put me under oath on my oath my king i will speak  i am not the slayer nor can i reveal him  as for the investigation it was for phoebus who enjoined it to tell us who did the deed
oedipus
justly said  but no man on earth can force the gods to do what they do not want
chorus
i would like to say what seems to me the next best course
oedipus
and if there is a third course do not hesitate to reveal it too
chorus
i know that our lord teiresias is the seer most like our
lord apollo from him my king an investigator might learn most clearly about these affairs
oedipus
not even this have i neglected  on creons suggestion i sent a man twice to bring him  and i have been wondering for some time why he is not here
chorus
indeed his skill apart the rumors are but faint and old
oedipus
what are the rumors  i am investigating every tale
chorus
he was said to have been killed by some wayfarers
oedipus
i too have heard that  but no one sees the one who saw it
chorus
if he knows what fear is he will not hesitate to come forward when he
hears your curses so dire are they
oedipus
when a man does not shrink from a deed he is not scared by a word
chorus
but there is no one to convict him  but here they bring at last the godlike prophet the only man in whom truth lives
teiresias enters led by a boy
oedipus
teiresias whose soul grasps all things both that which may be told and that which is unspeakable the olympian secrets and the affairs of the earth you feel though you cannot see what a huge plague haunts our state  from which great prophet we find you to be our protector and only savior
now phoebus if indeed you have not already heard the news sent answer to our question that the only way to rid ourselves of this pest that afflicts us is to discover the slayers of laius and then to slay them or banish them from our land
so do not begrudge us the voice of the birds or any other path of prophecy but save yourself and your state save me save all that is defiled by the dead  we are in your hands and mans noblest task is to help others
to the best of his means and powers
teiresias
alas how terrible it is to have wisdom when it does not benefit those who have it  i knew this well but let it slip from my mind otherwise i would not have come here
oedipus
what now how disheartened you have come
teiresias
let me go home  for you will bear your own burden to the end and i will bear mine if you consent
oedipus
your words are strange and unkind to the state which nurtured you since you withhold this response
teiresias
i see that you for your part speak inappropriately
therefore do not speak so i will not suffer the same
oedipus
for the love of the gods do not turn away if you have knowledge all we suppliants implore you on our knees
teiresias
for all of you are without knowledge  but never will i reveal my troubles not to call them yours
oedipus
what are you saying do you know the secret and refuse to tell it will you betray and destroy the state
teiresias
i will grieve neither myself nor you  why do you ask these things in vain  you will not learn the answers from me
oedipus
will you not basest of the base
you would anger a stone speak out  can nothing touch you will you never make an end
teiresias
you blame my anger but do not perceive your own no you blame me
oedipus
who would not be angry hearing such words
with which you now are slighting the city
teiresias
the future will come of itself though i shroud it in silence
oedipus
since it must come anyway it is right that you tell it to me
teiresias
i will speak no further rage if you wish with the fiercest wrath your heart knows
oedipus
in my anger i will not spare to speak all my thoughts  know that you seem to me to have helped in plotting the deed and to have done it short of performing the actual murder with your own hands if you had eyesight i would have said that you had done even this by yourself
teiresias
in truth i order you to abide by you own decree and from this day forth not to speak to these men or to me you are the accursed defiler of this land
oedipus
so brazen with your blustering taunt
where do you think to escape to
teiresias
i have escaped  there is strength in my truth
oedipus
who taught you this  not your skill at any rate
teiresias
you yourself  for you spurred me on to speak against my will
oedipus
what did you say speak again so i may learn it better
teiresias
did you not understand before or are you talking to test me
oedipus
i cannot say i understood fully  tell me again
teiresias
i say that you are the killer of the man whose slayer you seek
oedipus
now you will regret that you have said such dire words twice
teiresias
should i tell you more that you might get more angry
oedipus
say as much as you want it will be said in vain
teiresias
i say that you have been living in unguessed shame with your closest kin and do not see into what woe you have fallen
oedipus
do you think that you will always be able to speak like this without smarting for it
teiresias
yes if indeed there is any strength in truth
oedipus
but there is except not for you  you do not have that strength since you are maimed in your ears in your wit and in your eyes
teiresias
and you are a poor wretch to utter taunts that every man here will soon hurl at you
oedipus
night endless night has you in her keeping so that you can never hurt me
or any man that sees the light of the sun
teiresias
no it is not your fate to fall at my hands since apollo to whom this matter is a concern is sufficient
oedipus
are these creons devices or your own
teiresias
creon is no trouble for you you are your own
oedipus
o wealth and empire and skill surpassing skill in lifes keen rivalries how great is the envy in your keeping if for the sake of this office which the city has entrusted to me a gift unsought
creon the trustworthy creon my old friend has crept upon me by stealth yearning to overthrow me and has suborned such a scheming juggler as this a tricky quack who has eyes only for profit but is blind in his art
come tell me where have you proved yourself a seer  why when the watchful dog who wove dark song was here did you say nothing to free the people  yet the riddle at least was not for the first comer to read there was need of a seers help
and you were discovered not to have this art either from birds or known from some god  but rather i oedipus the ignorant stopped her having attained the answer through my wit alone untaught by birds  it is i whom you are trying to oust assuming that
you will have great influence in creons court  but i think that you and the one who plotted these things will rue your zeal to purge the land if you did not seem to be an old man you would have learned to your cost how haughty you are
chorus
to our way of thinking these words both his and yours oedipus
have been said in anger  we have no need of this but rather we must seek how we shall best discharge the mandates of the god
teiresias
though you are king the right of reply must be considered the same for both over that i have control
for i do not live as your slave but as loxias i will not stand enrolled as creons client  and i tell you since you have taunted my blindness that though you have sight you do not see what a state of misery you are in or where you dwell or with whom
do you know who your parents are  you have been an unwitting enemy to your own kin both in the underworld and on the earth above and the double lash of your mothers and your fathers curse will one day drive you from this land in dreadful haste with darkness upon those eyes of yours which now can see
what place will be harbor to your cries what part of all cithaeron will not ring with them soon when you have learned the meaning of the nuptials in which within that house you found a fatal haven after a voyage so fair  and you have not guessed at a throng of other ills
which will bring you level with your true self and with your own children  therefore heap your scorn upon creon and upon my message for no man will ever be crushed more miserably than you
oedipus
are these taunts to be endured from him
be gone to your ruin be gone this instant  will you not turn your back and leave this house
teiresias
i would not have come if you had not called me
oedipus
i did not know you would speak foolishly for otherwise it would have been a long time before i summoned you to my home
teiresias
i was born like this as you think a fool but in the opinion of the parents who bore you quite sane
oedipus
what parents wait  what man is my father
teiresias
this day will reveal your birth and bring your ruin
oedipus
what riddles what dark words you always say
teiresias
are you not the best at unravelling mysteries
oedipus
reproach me in what you will find me to be great
teiresias
yet it was just that fortune that undid you
oedipus
but if it saved this city i care not
teiresias
i will take my leave  you boy lead me
oedipus
yes let him take you while here you are a hindrance a source of trouble  when you have gone you will vex me no more
teiresias
i will go when i have performed the errand for which i came fearless of your frown you can never destroy me  i tell you the man whom you have been seeking this long while
uttering threats and proclaiming a search into the murder of laius is here ostensibly an alien sojourner but soon to be found a native of thebes nor will he enjoy his fortune  a blind man though now he sees
a beggar though now rich he will make his way to a foreign land feeling the ground before him with his staff  and he will be discovered to be at once brother and father of the children with whom he consorts son and husband of the woman who bore him
heir to his fathers bed shedder of his fathers blood  so go in and evaluate this and if you find that i am wrong say then that i have no wit in prophecy
chorus
who is he of whom the divine voice from the delphian rock has said
to have wrought with bloodred hands horrors that no tongue can tell  it is time that he ply in flight a foot stronger than the feet of stormswift steeds
the son of zeus is springing upon him with fiery lightning and with him come the dread unerring fates
chorusrecently the message has flashed forth from snowy parnassus
ordering all to search for the unknown man  he wanders under cover of the wild wood among caves and rocks fierce as a bull wretched and forlorn on his joyless path still seeking to separate himself from the doom revealed at the central shrine of the earth
but that doom lives forever forever flits around him
chorusthe wise augur moves me neither approving nor denying with dread with dread indeed
i am at a loss what to say  i am flustered in my expectations seeing neither the present nor the future clearly  never in past days or in these have i heard how the house of labdacus or the son of polybus had any quarrel with one another that
i could bring as proof in assailing the public reputation of oedipus seeking to avenge the line of labdacus
for the undiscovered murder
choruszeus and apollo indeed are keen of thought and know the affairs of the earth
but there is no sure test of whether a mortal seer attains more knowledge than i do though man may surpass man in wisdom  but until i see the word made good i will never assent when men blame oedipus  before all eyes the winged maiden came against him once upon a time and he was seen to be wise
and bore the test in welcome service to the state  never therefore will he be adjudged guilty of evil
creon
fellow citizens having learned that oedipus the king lays dire charges against me i have come in indignation
if he thinks that in the present troubles he has suffered from me by word or by deed anything harmful truly i do not desire my full term of years when i must bear such blame as this  the wrong of this rumor
touches me not in one point alone but has the largest scope if i am to be called a traitor in the city a traitor by you and by my friends
chorus
but perhaps this taunt came under the stress of anger rather than from the purpose of his heart
creon
was the opinion given that my counsels had brought the seer to utter his falsehoods
chorus
such things were said i do not know with what meaning
creon
and was this charge laid against me with steady eyes and steady mind
chorus
i do not know  i see not what my masters do  but here comes our lord from the house
oedipus enters
oedipus
you how did you get here are you so boldfaced that you have come to my house you who are manifestly the murderer of its master
the palpable thief of its crown  come tell me in the name of the gods was it cowardice or folly which you saw in me and which led you to plot this thing  did you think that i would not notice this deed of yours creeping upon me by stealth or that if i became aware of it i would not ward it off
is your attempt not foolish to seek the throne without followers or friends a prize which followers and wealth must win
creon
mark me now hear a fair reply in answer to your words and then judge for yourself on the basis of knowledge
oedipus
you are apt in speech but i have a poor wit for lessons since i have found you a malignant foe
creon
now hear first how i will explain this very thing
oedipus
one thing that you are not false do not bother to explain to me
creon
if you think that stubbornness
without sense is a virtue you are not wise
oedipus
if you think you can wrong a kinsman and escape the penalty you are not sane
creon
justly said i grant you but tell me what the wrong is that you say you are suffering at my hands
oedipus
did you or did you not advise me to send for that reverend seer
creon
even now i am of the same mind
oedipus
how long is it then since laius
creon
did what  i do not understand
oedipus
was swept out of sight by deadly violence
creon
the count of years would run far into the past
oedipus
did this seer possess this skill in those days
creon
he was wise as now and held in equal honor
oedipus
did he make mention of me at that time
creon
never certainly when i was within hearing
oedipus
did you never investigate the murder
creon
due search we made of course though we learned nothing
oedipus
and how was it that this sage did not tell this story then
creon
i do not know where i lack insight it is my custom to be silent
oedipus
this much at least you know and could declare with insight enough
creon
what is that if i know it i will not deny it
oedipus
that if he had not conferred with you he would not have named me as laius slayer
creon
if he says this you know best but i deem it just
to learn from you as much as you have from me now
oedipus
learn your fill  i will never be found guilty of the bloodshed
creon
say then have you married my sister
oedipus
the question allows no denial
creon
and you rule the land as she does with equal sway
oedipus
she obtains from me all that she wishes
creon
and do i not rank as a third peer of you two
oedipus
it is just in this that you are seen to be a false friend
creon
not so if you would reason with your heart as i do with mine  weigh this first whether you think that anyone would
choose to rule amid terrors rather than in unruffled peace granted that he is to have the same powers  now i for one have by nature no yearning to rule as a king rather than to do kingly deeds and neither does any man i know who has a sound mind
for now i attain all everything from you without fear but if i were ruler myself i would have to do much that went against my own pleasure
how then could royalty be sweeter to me to have than painless rule and influence  i am not yet so misguided
that i desire other honors than those which bring profit  now every man has a greeting for me now all that have a request of you crave to speak with me since in me lies all their hope of success  why then should i give up these things and take those others
no mind will become false while it is wise  no i am no lover of such a policy and if another put it into action i could never bear to go along with him  and in proof of this first go to pytho and ask whether i brought a true report of the oracle
then next if you have found that i have planned anything in concert with the soothsayer take and slay me by the sentence not of one mouth but of two by my own no less than yours  but do not assume my guilt on unproven inference  it is not just to judge bad men good at random
or good men bad  i think that casting off a true friend is for a man like casting away the life in his own bosom which he most loves  you will surely learn about these affairs in time since time alone reveals a just man
but you can discern a bad man even in one day alone
chorus
he has spoken well my king for one who is taking care not to fall those who are quick in counsel are not sure
oedipus
when the stealthy plotter is moving on me quickly i too must be quick in my counterplot
if i await him in repose his ends will have been gained and mine lost
creon
what do you want then to banish me from the land
oedipus
hardly  i desire your death not your exile so that i might show what a thing envy is
creon
are you resolved not to yield or believe
oedipus
no for you persuade me that you are unworthy of trust
creon
no for i see you are not sane
oedipus
sane at least in my own interest
creon
but you should be so in mine also
oedipus
you are false
creon
but if you understand nothing
oedipus
still i must rule
creon
not if you rule badly
oedipus
hear him city of thebes
creon
the city  is mine too not yours alone
chorus
cease lords  in good time i see iocasta coming from the house with whose help you should resolve your present feud
iocasta enters
iocasta
misguided men why have you raised
such a foolish argument  are you not ashamed while the land is so sick to stir up troubles of your own come go into the house and you creon go to yours and stop making so much of a petty grief
creon
kinswoman oedipus your husband
wants to do one of two terrible things to me either to thrust me from the land of my fathers or to arrest and slay me
oedipus
yes indeed for i have caught him lady working evil against my person with his wicked craft
creon
may i derive no benefit
but perish accursed if i have done any of the things of which you charge me
iocasta
in the name of the gods believe it oedipus first for the sake of this awful oath to the gods then for my sake and for the sake of those who stand before you
chorus
consent reflect listen my king i beg you
oedipus
what would you have me grant you
chorus
respect him who was in the past not foolish and who now is strong in his oath
oedipus
do you understand what you crave
chorus
i do
oedipus
tell me then what you mean
chorus
that you should never use an unproved rumor to cast a dishonoring charge on the friend who has bound himself with a curse
oedipus
then be quite aware that when you seek this you are seeking death or exile from this land for me
chorus
no by the god that stands at the head of all the host of the gods no by the sun  unblest unbefriended may i die the worst possible death if i have this thought
but my unhappy soul is worn by the withering of the land as well as by the thought that our old sorrows should be crowned by new ones arising from the two of you
oedipus
then let him go though i am surely doomed to be killed
or thrust dishonored from the land  your words not his move me to compassion
chorus
you are truly sullen in yielding as you are vehement in the excesses of your wrath  but such natures are
justly most difficult for themselves to bear
oedipus
will you not be gone and leave me in peace
creon
i will go on my way  i have found you undiscerning but in the view of these men i am justhe exits
chorus
lady why do you hesitate to take this man into the house
iocasta
i will when i have learned what has happened
chorus
blind suspicion bred of talk arose and injustice inflicts wounds
iocasta
on both sides
chorus
yes
iocasta
and what was the story
chorus
it is enough i think enough when our land is already vexed that the matter should rest where it stopped
oedipus
do you see to what you have come for all your noble intent in seeking to slacken and blunt my zeal
chorus
king i have said it more than once
be sure that i would have proved myself a madman bankrupt in sane counsel if i forsook you you who gave a true course to my beloved country when it was
distraught with troubles and who now are likely to prove our prospering guide
iocasta
in the name of the gods tell me king the reason that you have conceived this steadfast wrath
oedipus
that i will do for i honor you lady above these men  creon is the cause and the plots he has laid against me
iocasta
come tell me how the argument began
oedipus
he says that i stand guilty  of laius blood
iocasta
on his own knowledge or on hearsay from another
oedipus
he has made a rascal seer his mouth piece as for himself he keeps his lips wholly pure
iocasta
then absolve yourself of the things about which you are speaking  listen to me and take comfort in learning that nothing of mortal birth shares in the science of the seer
i will give you a pithy proof of this  an oracle came to laius once i will not say from phoebus himself but from his ministers saying that he would suffer his doom at the hands of the child to be born to him and me
and laius as at least the rumor goes was murdered one day by foreign robbers at a place where the three highways meet  and the childs birth was not yet three days past when laius pinned his ankles together and had him thrown by others hands on a remote mountain
so in that case apollo did not bring it to pass that the child should become the slayer of his father or that laius should suffer that which he feared death at the hands of his child thus the messages of the seers art had mapped out the future pay them no regard  whatever necessary event
the god seeks he himself will easily bring to light
oedipus
what restlessness of soul lady what tumult has come upon me since i heard you speak
iocasta
what anxiety has startled you that you say this
oedipus
i thought that i heard this from you that laius
was slain where the three roads meet
icasta
yes that was the report and so it is still thought
oedipus
and where is the place where this occurred
iocasta
the land is called phocis the branching forks lead to the same spot from delphi and from daulia
oedipus
and how much time has passed since these events took place
iocasta
the news was announced to the town shortly before you first attained power over this land
oedipus
o zeus what have you decreed for me
iocasta
why oedipus does this matter weigh upon your heart
oedipus
do not ask me yet  tell me rather what stature laius had and how ripe his manhood was
iocasta
he was tall the silver just lightly strewn among his hair and his form was not greatly unlike your own
oedipus
unhappy that i am  i think that i have
laid myself under a terrible curse without realizing it
iocasta
how do you mean i tremble when i look at you my lord
oedipus
i have dread fears that the seer can see  but you will reveal the matter better if you tell me one thing more
iocasta
indeed though i tremble i will hear and answer all that you ask
oedipus
did he go with a small force or like a chieftain with many armed followers
iocasta
five they were in all a herald among them and there was one carriage which bore laius
oedipus
alas it is all clear now who gave you this information lady
iocasta
a servant the only survivor who returned home
oedipus
is he by any chance in the house now
iocasta
no  soon after he returned and found you ruling in laius stead
he pled with me with hand laid on mine to send him to the fields to the pastures of the flocks that he might be far from the sight of this town  and i sent him he was worthy for a slave to win even a larger favor than that
oedipus
would then that he return to us without delay
iocasta
that is easy  but why do you enjoin this
oedipus
i fear lady that my words have been rash  and therefore i wish to see him
iocasta
he will come  but i think that
i too have a claim to learn what lies heavy on your heart my king
oedipus
oedipus
it will not be kept from you now that my forebodings have advanced so far  to whom more than to you would i speak in suffering such a fortune as this  my father was polybus of corinth
my mother the dorian merope  i was considered the greatest of the folk in that town until a chance event befell me worthy indeed of wonder though not of my overreaction regarding it  at a banquet a man drunk with wine
cast it at me that i was not the true son of my father  and i vexed restrained myself for that day as best as i could but on the next went to my mother and father and questioned them  they were angry at the one who had let this taunt fly
so i had comfort about them but the matter rankled in my heart for such a rumor still spread widely  i went to delphi without my parents knowledge and phoebus sent me forth disappointed of the knowledge for which i had come
but in his response set forth other things full of sorrow and terror and woe that i was fated to defile my mothers bed that i would reveal to men a brood which they could not endure to behold and that i would slay the father that sired me  when i heard this i turned in flight from the land of corinth
from then on thinking of it only by its position under the stars to some spot where i should never see fulfillment of the infamies foretold in my evil fate  and on my way i came to the land in which you say that this prince perished
now lady i will tell you the truth  when on my journey i was near those three roads there i met a herald and a man in a carriage drawn by colts as you have described  the leader and the old man
himself tried to thrust me rudely from the path  then in anger i struck the one pushing me aside the driver and the old man when he saw this watched for the moment i was passing and from his carriage brought his double goad straight down on my head
yet he was paid back with interest with one swift blow from the staff in this hand he rolled right out of the carriage onto his back  i slew every one of them  but if this stranger had any tie of kinship to laius
who is now more wretched than this man before you  what mortal could be proved more hateful to the gods  no stranger no citizen is allowed to receive him at home it is unlawful for anyone to accost him and all must push him from their homes  and this this curse
was laid on me by no other mouth than my own  and i pollute the bed of the slain man with the hands by which he perished  am i now vile  oh am i not utterly unclean seeing that i must be banished and in banishment neither see my own people
nor set foot in my own land or else be joined in wedlock to my mother and slay my father polybus who sired and reared me then would he who judged these things to be sent down by some cruel divinity not be right about oedipus
prevent prevent you pure and awful gods me from ever seeing that day  no may i be swept away from all men before i see myself visited with that brand of doom
chorus
to us king these things are fraught with fear  yet have hope until at least you have gained full knowledge
from the one who saw the deed
oedipus
i have in truth this much hope alone i await the man summoned from the pastures
iocasta
and what do you want from him when he appears
oedipus
i will tell you  if his story is found
to match withwith yours i at least will stand clear of disaster
iocasta
and what special note did you hear from me
oedipus
you said that he spoke of laius as slain by robbers  if then he still speaks of several as before i was not the slayer
a solitary man could not be considered the same as that band  but if he names one lonely wayfarer then beyond doubt this guilt rests upon me
iocasta
be assured that thus at least the tale was first told  he cannot revoke that
for the city heard it not i alone  but even if he should diverge somewhat from his former story never king can he show that the murder of laius at least is truly square with the prophecy for loxias plainly said that he was to die at the hand of my child
how was it then that that poor innocent never slew him but perished first  from now on then as far as divination goes i would not look to my right hand or my left
oedipus
you are right  but nevertheless send someone to fetch the peasant
and do not neglect this matter
iocasta
i will send for him without delay  but let us go into the house i will do nothing which does not please youexeunt oedipus and iocasta
chorus
may destiny still find me winning the praise of reverent purity in all words and
deeds sanctioned by those laws of sublime  range called into life through the high clear aether whose father is olympus alone  their parent was no race of mortal men
no nor shall oblivion ever lay them to sleep the god is mighty in them and he does not grow old
chorusinsolence breeds the tyrant  insolence once vainly stuffed with wealth
that is not proper or good for it when it has scaled the topmost ramparts is hurled to a dire doom where ones feet cannot serve to good advantage  but i pray that the god never
quell such rivalry as benefits the state  i will always hold the god as our protector
chorusbut if any man walks haughtily in deed or word
with no fear of justice no reverence for the images of gods may an evil doom seize him for his illstarred pride if he does not gain his advantage fairly
or avoid unholy deeds but seeks to lay profaning hands on sanctities  where such things occur what mortal shall boast any more that he can ward off the arrow of the gods from his life
no  for if such deeds are held in honor why should we join in the sacred dance
chorusno longer will i go reverently to the earths central and inviolate shrine no more to abaes temple or to olympia
if these oracles do not fit the outcome so that all mortals shall point at them with their fingers
no king if this you are rightly called zeus all ruling may it not escape you and your deathless power  the old prophecies concerning laius are fading already men give them no value and nowhere is apollo glorified with honors
the worship of the gods is perishing
iocasta
princes of the land i am planning to visit the shrines of the gods with this wreathed branch and these gifts of incense in my hands  for oedipus excites his soul excessively with all sorts of grief
as he does not judge the new things from the old like a man of sense but is under the control of the speaker if he speaks of frightful things  since then i can do no good by counsel to you lycean apollo for you are nearest
i have come as a suppliant with these symbols of prayer that you may find us some escape from uncleanliness  for now we are all afraid like those who see fear in the helmsman of their ship
enter a messenger
messenger
can you tell me strangers where
the house of king oedipus is  or better still tell me where he himself is if you know
chorus
this is his dwelling and he himself stranger is within  this lady here is the mother of his children
messenger
then may she be ever happy in a happy home
since she is his blessed queen
iocasta
happiness to you also stranger  your fair greeting deserves this  but say what you have come to seek or to tell
messenger
good tidings lady for your house and your husband
iocasta
what are they  from whom have you come
messenger
from corinth and at the message i will give now you will doubtless rejoice though you may perhaps grieve too
iocasta
what is it  why has it this double potency
messenger
the people will make him king of the
isthmian land as it was said there
iocasta
how then  is the aged polybus no longer in power
messenger
no for death holds him in the tomb
iocasta
what do you mean  is polybus dead old man
messenger
if i do not speak the truth i am content to die
iocasta
handmaid away with all speed and tell this to your master  oracles of the gods where do you stand now it is this man that oedipus long feared he would slay  and now this man has died in the course of destiny not by his hand
enter oedipus
oedipus
iocasta dearest wife why have you summoned me forth from these doors
iocasta
hear this man and judge as you listen what the awful oracles have come to
oedipus
who is he and what news does he have for me
iocasta
he comes from corinth to tell you that your father polybus lives no longer but has perished
oedipus
how stranger  let me have it from your own mouth
messenger
if i must first make these tidings plain know indeed that he is dead and gone
oedipus
by treachery or from illness
messenger
a light tilt of the scale brings the aged to their rest
oedipus
ah he died it seems of sickness
messenger
yes and of the long years that he had lived
oedipus
alas alas why indeed my wife should one look to the
hearth of the pythian seer or to the birds that scream above our heads who declared that i was doomed to slay my father  but he is dead and lies beneath the earth and here i am not having put my hand to any spear unless perhaps he died out of longing for me
thus indeed i would be the cause of his death but as the oracles stand at least polybus has swept them with him to his rest in hades  they are worth nothing
iocasta
did i not long ago foretell this to you
oedipus
you did but i was mislead by my fear
iocasta
now no longer take any of those things to heart
oedipus
but surely i must fear my mothers bed
iocasta
what should a mortal man fear for whom the decrees of fortune are supreme and who has clear foresight of nothing  it is best to live at random as one may
but fear not that you will wed your mother  many men before now have slept with their mothers in dreams  but he to whom these things are as though nothing bears his life most easily
oedipus
all these words of yours would have been well said
were my mother not alive  but as it is since she lives i must necessarily fear though you do speak well
iocasta
your fathers death is a great sign for us to take cheer
oedipus
great i know  but my fear is of her who lives
messenger
and who is the woman about whom you fear
oedipus
merope old man the consort of polybus
messenger
and what is it in her that moves your fear
oedipus
a divine oracle of dread import stranger
messenger
proper or improper for another to know
oedipus
proper surely  loxias once said that i was
doomed to marry my own mother and to shed with my own hands my fathers blood  for which reasons i long shirked my home in corinth with a happy outcome to be sure but still it is sweet to see the face of ones parents
messenger
was it really for fear of this that you became an exile from that city
oedipus
and because i did not wish old man to be the murderer of my father
messenger
why have i not relieved you of this second fear  my lord since i came to give you pleasure
oedipus
and indeed you will have worthy thanks from me
messenger
and indeed i came specially for this that
i might profit from your returning home
oedipus
but by no means will i ever go near my parents again
messenger
my son it is crystal clear that you do not know what you are doing
oedipus
how so old man  in the name of the gods tell me
messenger
if on account of this you are fleeing from returning home
oedipus
fearing indeed lest apollos prophecy come true in me
messenger
lest you acquire some pollution from your parents
oedipus
this very thing old man this constantly frightens me
messenger
do you know then that your fears are wholly in vain
oedipus
how so if i was born of those parents
messenger
because you had no blood in common with polybus
oedipus
what are you saying  was polybus not my father
messenger
just as much and no more than he who speaks to you
oedipus
and how can my father be equal to him who is as though nothing to me
messenger
but he did not father you any more than i did
oedipus
how then did he call me his son
messenger
long ago he received you as a gift from my hands
oedipus
and yet he loved me so dearly who came from anothers hand
messenger
his former childlessness won him over
oedipus
and had you bought me or found me by chance when you gave me to him
messenger
i found you in cithaerons winding glens
oedipus
and why were you roaming those regions
messenger
i was in charge of mountain flocks
oedipus
what you were a shepherd a vagrant hireling
messenger
but your savior my son in that hour
oedipus
and what was my pain when you took me in your arms
messenger
the ankles of your feet might bear witness
oedipus
ah me why do you speak of that old trouble
messenger
i freed you when you had your ankles pinned together
oedipus
it was a dread brand of shame that i took from my cradle
messenger
so much so that from that fortune you were called by that name which you still bear
oedipus
oh in the name of the gods was the deed my mothers or fathers speak
messenger
i know not  he who gave you to me knows better of that than i
oedipus
what you got me from another  you did not find me yourself
messenger
no  another shepherd gave you to me
oedipus
who was he  can you tell clearly
messenger
i think he was said to be one of the household of laius
oedipus
the king who ruled this country long ago
messenger
the same  the man was a herdsman in his service
oedipus
is he still alive that i might see him
messenger
you natives of this country should know best
oedipus
is there any of you here present that knows the herdsman of whom he speaks having seen him either in the pastures or here in town  answer
the hour has come for these things to be revealed finally
chorus
i think he speaks of no other than the peasant you already wanted to see  but our lady iocasta might best tell you that
oedipus
lady do you know the one whom we summoned just now
is it of him that this man speaks
iocasta
why ask of whom he spoke  regard it not waste not a thought on what he said it would be vain
oedipus
it must not happen that with such clues in my grasp i fail to bring my birth to light
iocasta
for the gods sake if you have any care for your own life do not continue this search  my anguish is enough
oedipus
be of good courage  even if i should be found the son of a servile mother a slave by three descents you will not be proven baseborn
iocasta
hear me i implore you do not do this
oedipus
i will not hear of not discovering the whole truth
iocasta
yet i wish you well i counsel you for the best
oedipus
these best counsels then vex my patience
iocasta
oh illfated man may you never know who you are
oedipus
go some one fetch me the herdsman
leave this woman to glory in her princely stock
iocasta
alas alas miserable man that word alone can i say to you and no other word ever againshe rushes into the palace
chorus
why has this woman gone oedipus rushing off in wild grief  i fear
a storm of sorrow will soon break forth from this silence
oedipus
break forth what will  be my race ever so lowly i crave to learn it  that woman perhaps for she is proud with more than a womans pride feels ashamed of my lowly origin  but i who hold myself son of fortune
that gives good will not be dishonored  she is the mother from whom i spring and the months my kinsmen have marked me sometimes lowly sometimes great  such being my heritage never more can i prove
false to it or keep from searching out the secret of my birth
chorus
if i am a seer or wise of heart
cithaeron you will not fail by heaven you will not to know at tomorrows full moon that oedipus honors you as native to him as his nurse and his mother and that you are celebrated in our dance and song
because you are wellpleasing to our prince  o phoebus to whom we cry may these things find favor in your sight
choruswho was it my son who of the race whose years are many that bore you in wedlock with
pan the mountainroaming father  or was it a bride of loxias that bore you  for dear to him are all the upland pastures
or perhaps it was cyllenes lord or the bacchants god dweller on the hilltops that received you a newborn joy from one of the nymphs of helicon with whom he most often sports
oedipus
elders if it is right for me who have never met the man to guess i think i see the herdsman we have been looking for for a lone time  in his venerable old age he tallies with this strangers years and moreover i recognize those who bring him i think as servants of mine
but perhaps you have an advantage in knowledge over me if you have seen the herdsman before
chorus
yes i know him be sure  he was in the service of laius trusty as any  shepherd
the herdsman is brought in
oedipus
i ask you first corinthian stranger if this is the man you mean
messenger
he is the one you are looking at
oedipus
you old man look this way and answer all that i ask were you once in the service of laius
servant
i was not a bought slave but reared in his house
oedipus
employed in what labor or what way of life
servant
for the better part of my life i tended the flocks
oedipus
and what regions did you most frequently haunt
servant
sometimes cithaeron sometimes the neighboring ground
oedipus
are you aware of ever having seen this man in these parts
servant
doing what what man do you mean
oedipus
this man here  have you ever met him before
servant
not so that i could speak at once from memory
messenger
and no wonder master  but i will bring clear recollection to his ignorance i am sure he knows well of the time we dwelled in the region of cithaeron
for six month periods from spring to arcturus he with two flocks and i his comrade with one  and then for the winter i used to drive my flock to my own fold and he took his to the fold of laius
did any of this happen as i tell it or did it not
servant
you speak the truth though it was long ago
messenger
come tell me now do you remember having given me a boy in those days to be reared as my own fosterson
servant
what now  why do you ask the question
messenger
this man my friend is he who then was young
servant
damn you  be silent once and for all
oedipus
do not rebuke him old man  your words need rebuking more than his
servant
and in what way most noble master do i offend
oedipus
in not telling of the boy about whom he asks
servant
he speaks without knowledge but is busy to no purpose
oedipus
you will not speak with good grace but will in pain
servant
no in the name of the gods do not mistreat an old man
oedipus
someone quick tie his hands him this instant
servant
alas why  what do you want to learn
oedipus
did you give this man the child about whom he asks
servant
i did  would that i had perished that day
oedipus
well you will come to that unless you tell the honest truth
servant
but if i speak i will be destroyed all the more
oedipus
this man is bent i think on more delays
servant
no no  i said before that i gave it to him
oedipus
where did you get it from  from your own house or from another
servant
it was not my own i received it from another
oedipus
from whom of the citizens here  from what home
servant
for the love of the gods master ask no more
oedipus
you are dead if i have to question you again
servant
it was a child then of the house of laius
oedipus
a slave or one of his own clan
servant
alas  i am on the brink of speaking the dreaded words
oedipus
and i of hearing i must hear nevertheless
servant
you must know then that it was said to be his own child   but your lady within could say best how these matters lie
oedipus
how  did she give it to you
servant
yes my lord
oedipus
for what purpose
servant
that i should do away with it
oedipus
her own child the wretched woman
servant
yes from fear of the evil prophecies
oedipus
what were they
servant
the tale ran that he would slay his father
oedipus
why then did you give him to this old man
servant
out of pity master thinking that he would carry him to another land from where he himself came  but he saved him for the direst woe
for if you are what this man says be certain that you were born illfated
oedipus
oh oh  all brought to pass all true  light may i now look on you for the last time i who have been found to be accursed in birth
accursed in wedlock accursed in the shedding of bloodhe rushes into the palace
chorus
alas generations of mortals how mere a shadow i count your life  where where is the mortal who
attains a happiness which is more than apparent and doomed to fall away to nothing  your fate warns me yours unhappy oedipus to call no
earthly creature blessed
chorusfor he o zeus shot his shaft with peerless skill and won the prize of an allprosperous fortune having slain the maiden with crooked talons who sang darkly
he arose for our land like a tower against death  and from that time oedipus you have been called our king and have been honored supremely holding power in great thebes
chorusbut now whose story is more grievous in mens ears
who is a more wretched slave to fierce plagues and troubles with all his life reversed  alas renowned oedipus  the same bounteous harbor was sufficient for you both as child and as father to make your nuptial couch in oh how can the soil
in which your father sowed unhappy man have endured you in silence for so long
chorustime the allseeing has found you out against your will he judges the monstrous marriage in which
parent and child have long been one  alas child of laius would that i had never seen you  i wail as one who pours a dirge from his lips
it was you who gave me new life to speak directly and through you darkness has fallen upon my eyes
a second messenger enters from the house
second messenger
you who are most honored in this land what deeds you will hear what deeds you will behold what burden of sorrow will be yours
if true to your race you still care for the house of labdacus  for i think that neither the ister nor the phasis could wash this house clean so many are the ills that it shrouds or will soon bring to light ills wrought not unwittingly but on purpose
and those griefs smart the most which are seen to be of our own choice
chorus
indeed the troubles which we knew before are far from being easy to bear  besides them what do you have to announce
second messenger
this is the shortest tale to tell and hear
our royal lady iocasta is dead
chorus
alas wretched lady  from what cause
second messenger
by her own hand  you will not suffer the worst part of the painful event since you do not behold the events  nevertheless so far as my memory serves
you will learn that unhappy womans fate
when frantic she passed within the vestibule she rushed straight towards her marriage couch clutching her hair with the fingers of both hands  once within the chamber
she dashed the doors together behind her then called on the name of laius long since a corpse thinking of that son born long ago by whose hand the father was slain leaving the mother to breed accursed offspring with his own child  and she bewailed the marriage in which wretched woman she had given birth to a twofold brood
husband by husband children by her child  and how she perished is more than i know  for with a shriek oedipus burst in and did not allow us to watch her woe until the end  on him as he rushed around our eyes were set
to and fro he went asking us to give him a sword asking where he could find the wife who was no wife but a mother whose womb had borne both him and his children  and in his frenzy a power greater than mortal man was his guide for it was none of us mortals who were near
with a dread cry as though someone beckoned him on he sprang at the double doors forced the bending bolts from the sockets and rushed into the room  there we beheld the woman hanging by the neck in a twisted noose of swinging cords
and when he saw her with a dread deep cry he released the halter by which she hung  and when the hapless woman was stretched out on the ground then the sequel was horrible to see  for he tore from her raiment the golden brooches with which she had decorated herself
and lifting them struck his own eyeballs uttering words like these  no longer will you behold such horrors as i was suffering and performing long enough have you looked on those whom you ought never to have seen having failed in the knowledge of those whom i yearned to know henceforth you shall be dark
with such a dire refrain he struck his eyes with raised hand not once but often  at each blow the bloody eyeballs bedewed his beard and sent forth not sluggish drops of gore but all at once a dark shower of blood came down like hail
from the deeds of the two of them such ills have broken forth not on one alone but with mingled woe for man and wife  the old happiness of their ancestral fortune was once happiness indeed  but now today lamentation ruin death shame and every earthly ill that anyone could name  are all theirs
chorus
and does the sufferer have any respite from pain now
second messenger
he cries for some one to unbar the gates and show to all the cadmeans his fathers slayer his mothers the words must not pass my lips
in order to banish himself from the land and not to put the house under his own curse by waiting here  and yet he lacks strength and one to guide his steps for the anguish is more than he can bear  he will soon show this to you look the bars of the gates are withdrawn
and soon you will behold a sight which even he who abhors it must pity
chorus
o dread fate for men to see o most dreadful of all that i have set my eyes on  unhappy one what madness has come upon you
who is the unearthly foe who with a leap of more than mortal range has made your illstarred life his prey  alas alas you hapless man  i cannot even look on you though there is much i desire to ask much i desire to learn
much that draws my wistful gaze  with such a shuddering do you fill me
oedipus
woe is me  alas alas wretched that i am  where where am i carried in my misery
how is my voice swept abroad on the wings of the air  oh my fate how far you have sprung
chorus
to a dread place dire in mens ears dire in their sight
oedipus
oh horror of darkness that enfolds me unspeakable visitant
resistless sped by a wind too favorable  oh me and once again oh me how my soul is pierced by the stab of these goads and by the memory of sorrows
chorus
no wonder that amidst these woes
you mourn and bear a double pain
oedipus
ah friend you still are steadfast in your care for me and still have patience to tend to the blind man ah me
your presence is not hidden from me no blind though i am nevertheless i know your voice full well
chorus
man of dread deeds how could you quench your vision in this way  what divinity urged you on
oedipus
it was apollo friends apollo who brought these troubles
to pass these terrible terrible troubles  but the hand that struck my eyes was none other than my own wretched that i am
why should i see when sight showed me nothing sweet
chorus
these things were just as you say
oedipus
what my friends can i behold anymore what can i love what greeting can touch my ear with joy  hurry friends
lead me from the land lead me from here the utterly lost
the thriceaccursed the mortal most hateful to the gods
chorus
wretched alike for your fortune and for your understanding of it would that i had never known you
oedipus
perish the man whoever he was who freed me in the past years from the cruel shackle on my feet a thankless deed  had i died then
i would not have been so sore a grief to my friends and to my own soul
chorus
i too would have had it thus
oedipus
in this way i would not have come to shed my fathers blood or been known among men as the husband of the woman from whom i was born
now i am forsaken by the gods son of a defiled mother successor to the bed of the man who gave me my own wretched being
if there is a woe surpassing all woes it has become oedipus lot
chorus
i cannot agree that you have counseled well you would have been better dead than living and blind
oedipus
do not tell me that things have not been best done in this way
give me counsel no more  if i had sight i know not with what eyes i could even have looked on my father when i came to the house of hades or on my miserable mother since against both i have sinned such sins as hanging myself could not punish
but do you think that the sight of children born as mine were was lovely for me to look upon no no never lovely to my eyes  no neither was this town with its towering walls nor the sacred statues of the gods since i thrice wretched that i am
i noblest of the sons of thebes have doomed myself to know them no more by commanding that all should reject the impious one the one whom the gods have revealed as unholy a member of laius own race  after bearing such a stain upon myself
was i to look with steady eyes on this folk  no indeed were there a way to choke the source of hearing i would not have hesitated to make a fast prison of this wretched frame so that i should have known neither sight nor sound
it is sweet for our thought to dwell beyond the sphere of grief  alas cithaeron why did you provide a shelter for me  when i was given to you why did you not slay me straightway that i might never reveal my origin to men  ah polybus ah corinth and you that were called the ancient house of my father
how fairseeming was i your nurseling and what evils were festering underneath  now i am found to be evil and of evil birth  oh you three roads and you secret glen you thicket and narrow way where three paths met
you who drank my fathers blood from my own hands do you remember perhaps what deeds i have performed in your sight and then what fresh deeds i went on to do when i came here  oh marriage rites you gave me birth and when you had brought me forth
you again bore children to your child you created an incestuous kinship of fathers brothers sons brides wives and mothers all the foulest deeds that are wrought among men  but it is improper to mention what it is improper to do
hurry for the love of the gods hide me somewhere beyond the land or slay me or cast me into the sea where you will never behold me any longer  approach deign to lay your hands on a wretched man listen and fear not  my plague can rest
on no other mortal
chorus
but here is creon in good time to plan and perform that which you request  he alone is left to guard the land in your place
oedipus
ah me how will i address him
what claim to credence can be shown on my part  for in the past i proved to be wholly false to him
enter creon
creon
i have not come to mock or reproach you with any any past fault
to the attendants
but you if you no longer respect the children of men
revere at least the allnurturing flame of our lord the sun and dont show so openly such a pollution as this one which neither earth nor holy rain nor the light itself can welcome  take him into the house as quickly as you can it best accords with pity that
kinfolk alone should see and hear a kinsmans woes
oedipus
for the gods love since you have done a gentle violence to my prediction and come in a spirit so noble to me a man most vile grant me a favor i will speak for your own good not mine
creon
and what do you wish so eagerly to get from me
oedipus
cast me out of this land with all speed to a place where no mortal shall be found to greet me
creon
this i could have done to be sure except i craved first to learn from the god all my duty
oedipus
but his pronouncement has been set forth in full to let me perish the parricide unholy one that i am
creon
thus it was said  but since we have come to such a pass it is better to learn clearly what should be done
oedipus
will you then seek a response on behalf of such a wretch as i
creon
yes for even you yourself will now surely put faith in the god
oedipus
yes  and on you i lay this charge to you i make this entreaty  give to the woman within such burial as you wish you will properly render the last rites to your own  but never let this city of my father be condemned
to have me dwelling within as long as i live  no allow me to live in the hills where cithaeron famed as mine sits which my mother and father while they lived fixed as my appointed tomb so that i may die according to the decree of those who sought to slay me
and yet i know this much that neither sickness nor anything else can destroy me for i would never have been snatched from death except in order to suffer some strange doom  but let my fate go where it will  regarding my children creon i beg you to take no care of my sons
they are men so that they will never lack the means to live wherever they should be  my two girls poor hapless ones who never knew my table spread separately or lacked their fathers presence but always had a share of all that
reached my hands i implore you to take care of them  and if you can allow me to touch them with my hands and to indulge my grief  grant it prince grant it noble heart  ah if i could but once touch them with my hands i would think that i had them
just as when i had sight
creons attendants lead in the children antigone and ismene
what is this  oh gods can it be my loved ones that i hear sobbing can creon have taken pity on me and sent my children my darlings
am i right
creon
you are  i have brought this about for i knew the joy which you have long had from them the joy you now have
oedipus
bless you and for this errand may the god prove a kinder guardian to you than he has to me
my children where are you  come here here to the hands of the one whose mother was your own the hands that have made your fathers once bright eyes to be such orbs as these his who seeing nothing knowing nothing
became your father by her from whom he was born  for you also do i weep though i cannot see you when i think of the bitter life that men will make you live in days to come   to what company of the citizens will you go to what festival
from which you will not return home in tears not sharing in the holiday  but when you reach a ripe age for marriage who shall he be who shall be the man my daughters to risk taking upon himself the reproaches
that will certainly be baneful to my offspring and yours  what misery is lacking  your father killed his own father and bore you from the source of his own being
such are the taunts that will be cast at you  and who then will wed you  the man does not live no it cannot be my children but you will wither in barren maidenhood  son of menoeceus hear me since you are the only father left to them we their parents are both gone
do not allow them to wander poor and unwed for they are your own kin nor abase them to the level of my woes  pity them seeing them deprived of everything but you at such an age
promise noble man and touch them with your hand  to you children i would have given much counsel if your minds were mature  but now pray that you may live where occasion allows and that the life which is your lot may be happier than your fathers
creon
your grief has had a sufficient scope move on into the house
oedipus
i must obey though i do it in no way gladly
creon
yes for it is in season that all things are good
oedipus
do you know on what terms i will go
creon
you will tell me and then i will know when i have heard them
oedipus
see that you send me to dwell outside this land
creon
you ask for what the god must give
oedipus
but to the gods i have become most hateful
creon
then you will quickly get your wish
oedipus
so you consent
creon
it is not my way to say idly what i do not mean
oedipus
then it is time to lead me away
creon
come then but let your children go
oedipus
no do not take them from me
creon
do not wish to be master in all things  the mastery which you did attain has not followed you through life
chorus
residents of our native thebes behold this is oedipus
who knew the renowned riddle and was a most mighty man  what citizen did not gaze on his fortune with envy  see into what a stormy sea of troubles he has come therefore while our eyes wait to see the final destined day we must call no mortal happy until
he has crossed lifes border free from pain
