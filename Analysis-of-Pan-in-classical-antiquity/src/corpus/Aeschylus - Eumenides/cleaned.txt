the priestess of pythian apollo
first in this prayer of mine i give the place of highest honor among the gods to the first prophet earth and after her to themis for she was the second to take this oracular seat of her mother as legend tells and in the third allotment with themis consent and not by force
another titan child of earth phoebe took her seat here she gave it as a birthday gift to phoebus who has his name from phoebe leaving the lakeand ridge of delos he landed on pallas shipfrequented shores
and came to this region and the dwelling places on parnassus the children of hephaistosroadbuilders taming the wildness of the untamed land escorted him with mighty reverence and at his arrival the people
and delphus helmsman and lord of this land made a great celebration for him zeus inspired his heart with prophetic skill and established him as the fourth prophet on this throne but loxias is the spokesman of zeus his father
these are the gods i place in the beginning of my prayer
and pallas who stands before the temple is honored in my words and i worship the nymphs where the corycianrock is hollow the delight of birds and haunt of gods bromius has held the region  i do not forget him  ever since he as a god led the bacchantes in war
and contrived for pentheus death as of a hunted hare i call on the streams of pleistus and the strength of poseidon and highest zeus the fulfiller and then i take my seat as prophetess upon my throne and may they allow me now to have the best fortune far better than on my previous entrances
and if there are any from among the hellenes here let them enter in turn by lot as is the custom for i prophesy as the god leadsshe enters the temple and after a brief interval returns terrorstricken
horrors to tell horrors for my eyes to see have sent me back from the house of loxias
so that i have no strength and i cannot walk upright i am running on hands and knees with no quickness in my limbs for an old woman overcome with fright is nothing or rather she is like a child
i was on my way to the inner shrine decked with wreaths i saw on the centerstonea man defiled in the eyes of the gods
occupying the seat of suppliants his hands were dripping blood he held a sword just drawn and an olivebranch from the top of the tree decorously crowned with a large tuft of wool a shining fleece for as to this i can speak clearly
before this man an extraordinary band of women slept seated on thrones no not women but rather gorgons i call them and yet i cannot compare them to forms of gorgons either once before i saw some creatures in a painting
carrying off the feast of phineus but these are wingless in appearance black altogether disgusting they snore with repulsive breaths they drip from their eyes hateful drops their attire is not fit to bring either before the statues of the gods or into the homes of men
i have never seen the tribe that produced this company nor the land that boasts of rearing this brood with impunity and does not grieve for its labor afterwards
let what is to come now be the concern of the master of this house
powerful loxias himself he is a prophet of healing a reader of portents and for others a purifier of homesexit
the interior of the temple is disclosed enter from the inner sanctuary apollo who takes his stand beside orestes at the centerstone near the suppliant are the furies asleep hermes in the background
apollo
no i will not abandon you your guardian to the end close by your side or far removed
i will not be gentle to your enemies so now you see these mad women overcome these loathsome maidens have fallen asleep old women ancient children with whom no god or man or beast ever mingles
they were even born for evil since they live in evil gloom and in tartarus under the earth creatures hateful to men and to the olympian gods nevertheless escape and do not be cowardly
for as you go always over the earth that wanderers tread they will drive you on even across the wide mainland beyond the sea and the island cities do not grow weary too soon brooding on this labor but when you have come to pallas city sit down and hold in your arms her ancient image
and there with judges of your case and speeches of persuasive charm we shall find means to release you completely from your labors for i persuaded you to take your mothers life
orestes
lord apollo you know how to do no wrong
and since you know this learn not to be neglectful also for your power to do good is assured
apollo
remember do not let fear overpower your heart you hermes my blood brother born of the same father watch over him true to your name
be his guideshepherding this suppliant of mine truly zeus respects this right of outlaws as he is sped on towards mortals with the fortune of a good escortexit orestes departs escorted by hermes the ghost of clytaemestra appears
ghost of clytaemestra
sleep on aha yet what need is there of sleepers it is due to you that i am thus dishonored among the other dead
because of those i killed the dead never cease to reproach me and i wander in disgrace i tell you that i am most greatly accused by them and yet although i have suffered cruelly in this way from my nearest kin
no divine power is angry on my behalf slaughtered as i have been by the hands of a matricide see these gashes in my heart and from where they came for the sleeping mind has clear vision but in the daytime the fate of mortals is unforeseeable
truly you have lapped up many of my offerings wineless libations a sober appeasement and i have sacrificed banquets in the solemn night upon a hearth of fire at an hour unshared by any god i see all this trampled under foot
but he has escaped and is gone like a fawn lightly indeed from the middle of snares he has rushed away mocking at you hear me since i plead for my life awake to consciousness goddesses of the underworld
for in a dream i clytaemestra now invoke you
chorus
（whine）the chorus begins to move uneasily uttering a whining sound
ghost of clytaemestra
whine if you will but the man is gone fled far away for he has friends that are not like mine
chorus
（whine）
the chorus continues to whine
ghost of clytaemestra
you are too drowsy and do not pity my suffering orestes the murderer of me his mother is gone
chorus
（moan）the chorus begins to moan
ghost of clytaemestra
you moan you drowse will you not get up at once is it your destiny to do anything other than cause harm
chorus
（moan）the chorus continues to moan
ghost of clytaemestra
sleep and toil effective conspirators have destroyed the force of the dreadful dragoness
chorus
with whining redoubled and intensified catch him catch him catch him catch him look sharp
ghost of clytaemestra
in a dream you are hunting your prey and are barking like a dog that never leaves off its keenness for the work what are you doing get up do not let fatigue overpower you and do not ignore my misery because you have been softened by sleep sting your heart with merited reproaches
for reproach becomes a spur to the rightminded send after him a gust of bloody breath shrivel him with the vapor the fire from your guts follow him wither him with fresh pursuitthe ghost of clytaemestra disappears the furies roused by their leader awake one after the other
chorus
awake wake her up as i wake you
still asleep get up shake off sleep let us see if any part of this beginningis in vain
chorus
oh oh alas we have suffered friends
indeed i have suffered much and all in vain we have suffered very painfully
oh an unbearable evil the beast has escaped from our nets and is gone  overcome by sleep i have lost my prey
chorus
oh child of zeus you have become a thief you a youth have ridden down old divinities
by showing respect to your suppliant a godless man and cruel to a parent although you are a god you have stolen away a man that killed his mother what is there here that anyone shall call just
chorus
reproach coming to me in a dream
struck me like a charioteer with goad held tight under my heart under my vitals i can feel the cruel the very cruel chill of the executioners destroying scourge
chorus
they do such things the younger gods who rule wholly beyond justice a throne dripping blood about its foot about its head
i can see the centerstone of the earth defiled with a terrible pollution of blood
chorus
although he is a prophet he has stained his sanctuary with pollution at its hearth at his own urging at his own bidding
against the law of the gods he has honored mortal things and caused the ancient allotments to decay
chorus
and he brings distress to me too but he shall not win his release even if he escapes beneath the earth he is never set free
a suppliant he will acquire another avenger from his family
enters from the inner sanctuary
apollo
out i order you go away from this house at once leave my prophetic sanctuary
so that you may not be struck by a winged glistening snake shot forth from a golden bowstring and painfully release black foam vomiting the clots of blood you have drained from mortals
it is not right for you to approach this house  no your place is where the punishments are beheading gouging out of eyes cutting of throats and where young mens virility is ruined by destruction of seed where there is mutilation and stoning and where those who are impaled beneath their spine moan long and piteously
do you hear what sort of feast is your delight you are detested by the gods for it the whole fashion of your form sets it forth creatures like you should live in the den of a blooddrinking lion and not inflict pollution on all near you in this oracular shrine
be gone you goats without a herdsman no god loves such a flock
chorus
lord apollo hear our reply in turn you yourself are not partially guilty of this deed you alone have done it all and are wholly guilty
apollo
what do you mean draw out the length of your speech this much
chorus
through your oracle you directed the stranger to kill his mother
apollo
through my oracle i directed him to exact vengeance for his father what of it
chorus
and then you agreed to take the fresh blood on yourself
apollo
and i ordered him to turn for expiation to this house
chorus
and do you then rebuke us the ones who escorted him here
apollo
yes for you are not fit to approach this house
chorus
but this has been assigned to us
apollo
what is this office of yours boast of your fine privilege
chorus
we drive matricides from their homes
apollo
but what about a wife who kills her husband
chorus
that would not be murder of a relative by blood
apollo
then truly you dishonor and bring to nothing the pledges of hera the fulfiller and zeus cypris too is cast aside dishonored by this argument
and from her come the dearest things for mortals for marriage ordained by fate for a man and a woman is greater than an oath and guarded by justice if then one should kill the other and you are so lenient as not to punish or visit them with anger
i claim that you unjustly banish orestes from his home for i see you taking the one cause very much to heart but clearly acting more leniently about the other but the goddess pallas will oversee the pleadings in this case
chorus
i will never never leave that man
apollo
pursue him then and get more trouble for yourself
chorus
do not cut short my privileges by your words
apollo
i would not take your privileges as a gift
chorus
no for in any case you are called great at the throne of zeus but as for me since a mothers blood leads me
i will pursue my case against this man and i will hunt him down exeunt
apollo
and i will aid my suppliant and rescue him for the wrath of the one who seeks purification is terrible among mortals and gods if i intentionally abandon himenters the sanctuary
the scene changes to athens before the temple of athena enter hermes with orestes who embraces the ancient image of the goddess
orestes
lady athena at loxias command i have come
receive kindly an accursed wretch not one who seeks purification or with unclean hand but with my guilts edge already blunted and worn away at other homes and in the travelled paths of men going over land and sea alike
keeping the commands of loxias oracle i now approach your house and image goddess here i will keep watch and await the result of my trial
the furies enter dispersedly hunting orestes trail by scent
chorus
chorus
aha this is a clear sign of the man
follow the hints of a voiceless informer for as a hound tracks a wounded fawn so we track him by the drops of blood my lungs pant from many tiring struggles for i have roamed over the whole earth and i have come over the sea in wingless flight
pursuing him no slower than a ship and now he is here somewhere cowering the smell of human blood gives me a smiling welcome
look look again look everywhere so that the matricide will not escape by secret flight with his debt unpaid
yes here he is again with a defense his arms twisted around the image of the immortal goddess he wishes to be tried for his debt
but that is not possible a mothers blood upon the earth is hard to recover alas the liquid poured on the ground is gone
but you must allow me in return to suck the red blood from your living limbs
may i feed on you a gruesome drink
i will wither you alive and drag you down so that you pay atonement for your murdered mothers agony
and you will see any other mortal who has sinned by not honoring a god or a stranger
or dear parents each having a just punishment
for hades is mighty in holding mortals to account under the earth and he observes all things and within his mind inscribes them
orestes
taught by misery i know many purification rituals and i know where it is right to speak and equally to be silent and in this case i have been ordered to speak by a wise teacher for the blood is slumbering and fading from my hand
the pollution of matricide is washed away while it was still fresh it was driven away at the hearth of the god phoebus by purifying sacrifices of swine it would be a long story to tell from the beginning how many people i have visited with no harm from association with me
time purges all things aging with them
so now with a pure mouth i piously invoke athena lady of this land to come to my aid without the spear she will win me and my land and the argive people
as faithful and true allies for all time but whether in some region of the libyan land near the waters of triton her native stream she is in action or at rest aiding those whom she loves or whether like a bold marshal she is surveying the phlegraean  plain
oh let her come as a goddess she hears even from far away to be my deliverer from distress
chorus
no neither apollo nor athenas strength can save you from perishing abandoned
not knowing where joy is in your heart a bloodless victim of the  gods below a shadow
you do not answer but scorn my words you who are fattened and consecrated to me living you will be my feast not slain
at an altar
now you will hear this hymn a spell to bind you
chorus
come now let us also join the dance since we are resolved to display our hated song and to declare our allotted office how our party directs the affairs of men
we claim to be just and upright no wrath from us will come stealthily to the one who holds out clean hands and he will go through life unharmed
but whoever sins as this man has and hides his bloodstained hands as avengers of bloodshed we appear against him to the end presenting ourselves as upright witnesses for the dead
chorus
o mother night hear me mother who gave birth to me as a retribution for the blind and the seeing for letos son dishonors me by snatching away this cowering wretch
a proper expiation for his mothers blood
chorus
this is our song over the sacrificial victim frenzied maddened destroying the mind
the furies hymn a spell to bind the soul not tuned to the lyre withering the life of mortals
chorus
for this is the office that relentless fate spun for us to hold securely
when rash murders of kin come upon mortals we pursue them until they go under the earth and after death they have no great freedom
chorus
this is our song over the sacrificial victim frenzied maddened destroying the mindthe furies hymn a spell to bind the soul not tuned to the lyre withering the life of mortals
chorus
this office was ordained for us at birth but the immortal gods must hold back their hands from us nor does any of them share a feast in common with us
and i have neither lot nor portion of pure white ceremonial robes
chorus
for i have chosen the overthrow of houses whenever violence raised in the home seizes someone near and dear
so speeding after this man we weaken him even though he is strong because of the fresh blood
chorus
we are eager to take these cares away from another
and to establish for the gods exemption from my concerns so that it will not come to trial for zeus has considered us a blooddripping hateful band unworthy of his council
chorus
for i have chosen the overthrow of houses whenever violence raised in the home seizes someone near and dear
a
speeding after this man we weaken him even though he is strong because of the fresh blood
chorus
and mens thoughts very proud under the sky waste away and dwindle in dishonor beneath the earth at our attack in black robes
and the vindictive dance of our feet
chorus
for surely with a great leap from above i bring down the heavily falling force of my foot my limbs that trip even swift runners
unendurable ruin
chorus
but as he falls he does not know it because of his senseless folly pollution hovers over the man in such darkness and mournful rumor speaks of a dark mist over his house
chorus
for surely with a great leap from above i bring down the heavily falling force of my foot my limbs that trip even swift runners
a
unendurable ruin
chorus
for it remains we are skilled in plotting powerful in execution and we remember evil deeds we are revered and hard for mortals to appease pursuing our allotted office which is without rights without honor
separated from the gods in sunless light our office that makes the path rough for seeing and dimsighted alike
chorus
what mortal then does not stand in awe and dread of this
when he hears from me the law ordained by fate given by the gods for perfect fulfilment my ancient privilege still remains i do not meet with dishonor
although i have my place under the earth and in sunless darkness
enter athena wearing the aegis
athena
from afar i heard the call of a summons from the scamander while i was taking possession of the land which the leaders and chiefs of the achaeans assigned to me a great portion of the spoil their spears had won
to be wholly mine forever a choice gift to theseus sons from there i have come urging on my tireless foot without wings rustling the folds of my aegis yoking this chariot to colts in their prime
as i see this strange company of visitors to my land i am not afraid but it is a wonder to my eyes who in the world are you i address you all in common this stranger sitting at my image and you who are like no race of creatures ever born
neither seen by gods among goddesses nor resembling mortal forms but it is far from just to speak ill of ones neighbor who is blameless and right stands aloof
chorus
daughter of zeus you will hear it all in brief
we are the eternal children of night we are called curses in our homes beneath the earth
athena
i now know your family and the names by which you are called
chorus
you will soon learn my office
athena
i shall understand if someone would tell the story clearly
chorus
we drive murderers from their homes
athena
and where is the end of flight for the killer
chorus
where joy is absent and unknown
athena
and would you drive this man with your shrieks to such  flight
chorus
yes for he thought it right to be his mothers murderer
athena
through other compulsions or in fear of someones wrath
chorus
where is there a spur so keen as to compel the murder of a mother
athena
two parties are present only half the case is heard
chorus
but he will not receive an oath nor does he want to give one
athena
you want to be called just rather than to act justly
chorus
how so teach me for you are not poor in subtleties
athena
i say that oaths must not win victory for injustice
chorus
well then question him and make a straight judgment
athena
then would you turn over the decision of the charge to me
chorus
how not since we honor you because you are worthy and of worthy parentage
athena
what do you want to say to this stranger in turn after you name your country and family and fortunes then defend yourself against this charge if indeed relying on the justice of your case you sit clinging to my image near my hearth
as a sacred suppliant like ixion to all this give me a plain answer
orestes
lady athena first of all i will take away a great anxiety from your last words i am not a suppliant in need of purification nor did i sit at your image with pollution on my hands
i will give you strong proof of this it is the law for one who is defiled by shedding blood to be barred from speech until he is sprinkled with the blood of a newborn victim by a man who can purify from murder
long before at other houses i have been thus purified both by victims and by flowing streams
and so i declare that this concern is out of the way as to my family you will soon learn i am an argive my father you rightly inquire about him
was agamemnon the commander of the naval forces along with him you made troy the city of ilion to be no city he did not die nobly after he came home but my blackhearted mother killed him after she covered him in a crafty snare that still remains to witness his murder in the bath
and when i came back home having been an exile in the time before i killed the woman who gave birth to me i will not deny it as the penalty in return for the murder of my dearlyloved father together with me loxias is responsible for this deed
because he threatened me with pains a goad for my heart if i should fail to do this deed to those who were responsible you judge whether i acted justly or not whatever happens to me at your hands i will be content
athena
the matter is too great if any mortal thinks to pass judgment on it
no it is not lawful even for me to decide on cases of murder that is followed by the quick anger of the furies especially since you by rites fully performed have come a pure and harmless suppliant to my house and so i respect you since you do not bring harm to my city
yet these women have an office that does not permit them to be dismissed lightly and if they fail to win their cause the venom from their resentment will fall upon the ground an intolerable perpetual plague afterwards in the land
so stands the case
either course to let them stay to drive them out brings disaster and perplexity to me but since this matter has fallen here i will select judges of homicide bound by oath and i will establish this tribunal for all time summon your witnesses and proofs
sworn evidence to support your case and i will return when i have chosen the best of my citizens for them to decide this matter truly after they take an oath that they will pronounce no judgment contrary to justice exit
chorus
here is the overturning of new laws
if the wrongful cause of this matricide is to triumph now his deed will accustom all men to recklessness
many sorrowful wounds given in truth by children wait for parents in the future time
chorus
for the wrath of us the furies who keep watch on mortals will not come stealthily upon such deeds
i will let loose death in every form and as he anticipates his neighbors evils one man will ask of another when hardship is to end or to decrease
and the poor wretch offers the vain consolation of uncertain remedies
chorus
do not let anyone who is struck by misfortune make an appeal and cry aloud this word
justice thrones of the furies perhaps some father or mother in new sorrow may cry out these words piteously now that the house of justice is falling
chorus
there is a time when fear is good and ought to remain seated as a guardian of the heart it is profitable to learn wisdom under strain
but who if he did not train his heart in fear either city or mortal would still revere justice in the same way
chorus
do not approve of a lawless life or one subject to a tyrant the god grants power to moderation in every form but he oversees other matters in different ways
i have a timely word of advice arrogance is truly the child of impiety but from health of soul
comes happiness dear to all much prayed for
chorus
and as for the whole matter i say to you respect the altar of justice and do not looking to profit dishonor it by spurning with godless foot
for punishment will come upon you the appointed fulfilment remains therefore let a man rightly put first in honor the reverence owed to his parents
and have regard for attentions paid to guests welcomed in his house
chorus
whoever is just willingly and without compulsion
will not lack happiness he will never be utterly destroyed but i say that the man who boldly transgresses amassing a great heap unjustly by force in time he will strike his sail
when trouble seizes him as the yardarm is splintered
chorus
he calls on those who hear nothing and he struggles in the midst of the whirling waters the god laughs at the hotheaded man
seeing him who boasted that this would never happen exhausted by distress without remedy and unable to surmount the cresting wave he wrecks the happiness of his earlier life on the reef of justice and he perishes unwept unseen
enter in procession athena a herald the jury of the areopagus a crowd of citizens orestes removes to the place appointed for the accused apollo appears after athenas first speech
athena
herald give the signal and restrain the crowd and let the piercing tyrrhenian trumpet filled with human breath send forth its shrill blare to the people for while this councilhall is filling
it is good to be silent and for my ordinances to be learned by the whole city for everlasting time and by these appellants so that their case may be decided well
enter apollo
chorus
lord apollo be master of what is yours say what part you have in this matter
apollo
i have come both to bear witness for this man was a lawful suppliant and a guest of my sanctuary and i am his purifier from bloodshed and to be his advocate myself i am responsible for the murder of his mother
to athena bring in the case and in accordance with your wisdom decide it
athena
to the furies it is for you to speak i am only bringing in the case for the prosecutor at the beginning speaking first shall rightly inform us of the matter
chorus
we are many but we will speak briefly
to orestes answer our questions one by one say first if you killed your mother
orestes
i killed her there is no denial of this
chorus
of the three falls that win the wrestling match this one is already ours
orestes
you make this boast over a man who is not down yet
chorus
you must however say how you killed her
orestes
i will say it with drawn sword in hand i stabbed her in the throat
chorus
by whom were you persuaded and on whose advice
orestes
by the oracles of this god here he is my witness
chorus
the prophet directed you to kill your mother
orestes
yes and to this very hour i do not blame my fortune
chorus
but if the jurys vote catches hold of you youll soon speak differently
orestes
i have good confidence my father will send protection from his grave
chorus
put your confidence in the dead now after you have killed your mother
orestes
i do for she was twice afflicted with pollution
chorus
how so teach the judges this
orestes
by murdering her husband she killed my father
chorus
and so although you are alive she is free of pollution by her death
orestes
but why did you not drive her into exile while she lived
chorus
she was not related by blood to the man she killed
orestes
then am i my mothers kin by blood
chorus
how else could she have nurtured you murderer beneath her belt do you reject the nearest kinship that of a mother
orestes
apollo give your testimony now explain on my behalf whether i was justified in killing her
for i do not deny that i did it as it is done but decide whether this bloodshed was to your mind just or not so that i may inform the court
apollo
i will speak justly before you athenas great tribunal since i am a prophet i cannot lie
i have never yet on my oracular throne said anything about a man or woman or city that zeus the father of the olympians did not command me to say
learn how strong this plea of justice is and i tell you to obey the will of my father
for an oath is not more powerful than zeus
chorus
zeus as you say gave you this oracular command to tell orestes here to avenge his fathers murder but to take no account at all of the honor due his mother
apollo
yes for it is not the same thing the murder of a noble man
honored by a godgiven scepter and his murder indeed by a woman not by rushing arrows sped from afar as if by an amazon but as you will hear pallas and those who are sitting to decide by vote in this matter
she received him from the expedition where he had for the most part won success beyond expectation in the judgment of those favorable to him then as he was stepping from the bath on its very edge she threw a cloak like a tent over it fettered her husband in an embroidered robe and cut him down
this was his death as i have told it to you the death of a man wholly majestic commander of the fleet as for that woman i have described her in such a way as to whet the indignation of the people who have been appointed to decide this case
chorus
zeus gives greater honor to a fathers death according to what you say
yet he himself bound his aged father cronus how does this not contradict what you say i call on you as witnessesturning to the judges to hear these things
apollo
oh monsters utterly loathed and detested by the gods zeus could undo fetters there is a remedy for that
and many means of release but when the dust has drawn up the blood of a man once he is dead there is no return to life for this my father has made no magic spells although he arranges all other things turning them up and down
nor does his exercise of force cost him a breath
chorus
see how you advocate acquittal for this man after he has poured out his mothers blood on the ground shall he then live in his fathers house in argos which of the public altars shall he use
what purification rite of the brotherhoods will receive him
apollo
i will explain this too and see how correctly i will speak the mother of what is called her child is not the parent but the nurse of the newlysown embryo the one who mounts is the parent whereas she as a stranger for a stranger
preserves the young plant if the god does not harm it  and i will show you proof of what i say a father might exist without a mother a witness is here at hand the child of olympian zeus who was not nursed in the darkness of a womb
and she is such a child as no goddess could give birth to
for my part pallas as in all other matters as i know how i will make your city and people great and i have sent this man as a suppliant to your sanctuary so that he may be faithful for all time
and that you goddess might win him and those to come after him as a new ally and so that these pledges of faith might remain always for the later generations of these people to cherish
athena
am i to assume that enough has been said and shall i now command these jurors to cast an honest vote according to their judgment
chorus
for our part every bolt is already shot but i am waiting to hear how the trial will be decided
athena
why not as for youto apollo and orestes how shall i arrange matters so that i will not be blamed by you
apollo
you have heard what you have heard and as you cast your ballots keep the oath sacred in your hearts friends
athena
hear now my ordinance people of attica as you judge the first trial for bloodshed in the future even as now this court of judges will always exist for the people of aegeus and this hill of ares the seat and camp of the amazons
when they came with an army in resentment against theseus and in those days built up this new citadel with lofty towers to rival his and sacrificed to ares from which this rock takes its name the hill of ares
on this hill the reverence of the citizens and fear its kinsman will hold them back from doing wrong by day and night alike so long as they themselves do not pollute the laws with evil streams if you stain clear water with filth you will never find a drink
neither anarchy nor tyranny this i counsel my citizens to support and respect and not to drive fear wholly out of the city for who among mortals if he fears nothing is righteous stand in just awe of such majesty
and you will have a defense for your land and salvation of your city such as no man has either among the scythians or in pelops realm i establish this tribunal untouched by greed worthy of reverence quick to anger awake on behalf of those who sleep a guardian of the land
i have prolonged this advice to my citizens for the future but now you must rise and take a ballot and decide the case under the sacred obligation of your oath my word has been spoken
the judges rise from their seats and cast their ballots one by one during the following altercation
chorus
and i counsel you not to dishonor us in any way since our company can be a burden to your land
apollo
and i for my part command you to stand in fear of the oracles both mine and zeus and not cause them to be unfulfilled
chorus
although it is not your office you have respect for deeds of bloodshed
you will prophesy dispensing prophecies that are no longer pure
apollo
then was my father mistaken in any way in his purposes when ixion who first shed blood was a suppliant
chorus
you do argue but if i fail to win the case i will once more inflict my company on this land as a burden
apollo
but you have no honor among both the younger and the older gods i will win
chorus
you did such things also in the house of pheres when you persuaded the fates to make mortals free from death
apollo
is it not right then to do good for a worshipper
especially when he is in need
chorus
it was you who destroyed the old dispensations when you beguiled the ancient goddesses with wine
apollo
soon when you have lost the case you will spit out your venom no great burden to your enemies
the balloting is now ended
chorus
since you a youth would ride me down an old woman i am waiting to hear the verdict in the case since i have not decided whether to be angry at the city
athena
it is my duty to give the final judgment and i shall cast my vote for orestes
for there was no mother who gave me birth and in all things except for marriage wholeheartedly i am for the male and entirely on the fathers side therefore i will not award greater honor to the death of a woman who killed her husband the master of the house
orestes wins even if the vote comes out equal
cast the ballots out of the urns as quickly as possible you jurors who have been assigned this taskthe ballots are turned out and separated
orestes
o phoebus apollo how will the trial be decided
chorus
o night our dark mother do you see this
orestes
now i will meet my end by hanging or i will live
chorus
yes and we will be ruined or maintain our honors further
apollo
correctly count the ballots cast forth friends and be in awe of doing wrong in the division of the votes  error of judgment is the source of much distress
and the cast of a single ballot has set upright a housethe ballots are shown to athena
athena
this man is acquitted on the charge of murder for the numbers of the casts are equalapollo disappears
orestes
pallas savior of my house i was deprived of a fatherland and it is you who have given me a home there again
the hellenes will say the man is an argive once again and lives in his fathers heritage by the grace of pallas and of loxias and of that third god the one who accomplishes everything the savior the one who having respect for my fathers death
saves me seeing those advocates of my mother
i will return to my home now after i swear an oath to this land and to your people for the future and for all time to come that no captain of my land
will ever come here and bring a wellequipped spear against them for i myself then in my grave will accomplish it by failure without remedy making their marches spiritless and their journeys
illomened
so that those who violate my present oath will repent their enterprise but while the straight course is preserved and they hold in everlasting honor this city of pallas with their allied spears i will be the more welldisposed to them
and so farewell you and the people who guard your city
may your struggle with your enemies let none escape bringing you safety and victory with the spearexit
chorus
younger gods you have ridden down the ancient laws and have taken them from my hands and i dishonored unhappy deeply angry
on this land alas i will release venom from my heart venom in return for my grief drops that the land cannot endure from it a blight that destroys leaves destroys children a just return
speeding over the plain will cast infection on the land to ruin mortals i groan aloud what shall i do i am mocked by the people what i have suffered is unbearable
ah cruel indeed are the wrongs of the daughters of night mourning over dishonor
athena
be persuaded by me not to bear it with heavy lament for you have not been defeated the trial resulted fairly in an equal vote without disgrace to you
but clear testimony from zeus was present and he himself who spoke the oracle himself gave witness that orestes should not suffer harm for his deed do not be angry do not hurl your heavy rage on this land
or cause barrenness letting loose drops whose savage spirit will devour the seed for i promise you most sacredly that you will have a cavernous sanctuary in a righteous land
where you will sit on shining thrones at your hearths worshipped with honor by my citizens here
chorus
younger gods you have ridden down the ancient laws and have taken them from my hands and i dishonored unhappy deeply angry
on this land alas i will release venom from my heart venom in return for my grief drops that the land cannot endure from it a blight that destroys leaves destroys children a just return
speeding over the plain will cast infection on the land to ruin mortals i groan aloud what shall i do i am mocked by the people what i have suffered is unbearable
ah cruel indeed are the wrongs of the daughters of night mourning over dishonor
athena
you are not dishonored so although you are goddesses do not in excessive rage blight past all cure a land of mortals
i also rely on zeus what need is there to mention that and i alone of the gods know the keys to the house where his thunderbolt is sealed but there is no need of that so yield to my persuasion and do not hurl the words of a reckless tongue against the land
that all things bearing fruit will not prosper calm the black waves bitter anger since you will receive proud honors and will live with me and when you have the firstfruits of this great land forever offerings on behalf of children and of marriage rites
you will praise my counsel
chorus
for me to suffer this alas for me with ancient wisdom to live beneath the earth alas without honor unclean i am breathing fury and utter rage
oh oh the shame of it what anguish steals into my breast hear my anger mother night for the deceptions of the gods hard to fight have deprived me of my ancient honors bringing me to nothing
athena
i will endure your anger for you are older and in that respect you are surely wiser than i yet zeus has given me too no mean understanding
but as for you if you go to a foreign land you will come to love this land i forewarn you for time flowing on will bring greater honor to these citizens and you having a seat of honor at the house of erechtheus
will obtain from hosts of men and women more than you could ever win from other mortals so do not cast on my realm keen incentives to bloodshed harmful to young hearts maddening them with a fury not of wine
and do not as if taking the heart out of fighting cocks plant in my people the spirit of tribal war and boldness against each other let their war be with foreign enemies and without stint for one in whom there will be a terrible passion for glory
but i say there will be no battling of birds within the home it is possible for you to choose such things from me bestowing good receiving good well honored in this land that is most beloved to the gods
chorus
for me to suffer this alas for me with ancient wisdom to live beneath the earth alas without honor unclean i am breathing fury and utter rage oh oh the shame of it what anguish steals into my breast
hear my anger mother night for the deceptions of the gods hard to fight have deprived me of my ancient honors bringing me to nothing
athena
no i will not grow tired of telling you about these good things so you will never be able to say that you an ancient goddess were cast out dishonored and banished from this land by me a younger goddess and by the mortal guardians of my city but if you give holy reverence to persuasion
the sweetness and charm of my tongue then you might remain but if you are not willing to stay then surely it would be unjust for you to inflict on this city any wrath or rage or harm to the people for it is possible for you to have a share of the land justly with full honors
chorus
lady athena what place do you say i will have
athena
one free from all pain and distress accept it
chorus
say that i have accepted it what honor awaits me
athena
that no house will flourish without you
chorus
will you gain for me the possession of such power
athena
yes for we will set straight the fortunes of those who worship
chorus
and will you give me a pledge for all time
athena
yes for i have no need to say what i will not accomplish
chorus
it seems you will win me by your spells i am letting go my anger
athena
then stay in the land and you will gain other friends
chorus
what blessings then do you advise me to invoke on this land
athena
blessings that aim at a victory not evil blessings from the earth and from the waters of the sea and from the heavens that the breathing gales of wind may approach the land in radiant sunshine
and that the fruit of the earth and offspring of grazing beasts flourishing in overflow may not fail my citizens in the course of time and that the seed of mortals will be kept safe may you make more prosperous the offspring of godly men
for i like a gardener cherish the race of these just men free of sorrowpointing to the audience
such blessings are yours to give i for my part will not allow this city to be without honor among mortals this city victorious in the glorious contests of deadly war
chorus
i will accept a home with pallas and i will not dishonor a city which she with zeus the omnipotent and ares holds as a fortress of the gods the bright ornament that guards the altars of the gods of hellas
i pray for the city with favorable prophecy that the bright gleam of the sun may cause blessings that give happiness to life to spring from the earth in plenty
athena
i act zealously for these citizens in this way installing here among them divinities great and hard to please for they have been appointed to arrange everything among mortals
yet the one who has not found them grievous does not know where the blows of life come from for the sins of his fathers drag him before them destruction in silence and hateful wrath levels him to the dust for all his loud boasting
chorus
may no hurtful wind blow to harm the trees i declare my favor and may no burning heat stealing the buds from plants pass the border of its proper place
may no deadly plague draw near to kill the fruit may the earth nurture the thriving flocks with twin offspring at the appointed time
and may the rich produce of the earth always pay the gods gift of lucky gain
athena
do you hear guards of my city the things she will accomplish for the lady erinys is very powerful
both with the deathless gods and with those below the earth and in their dealings with mankind they accomplish matters visibly perfectly to some giving songs to others a life made dim by tears
chorus
i forbid deadly and untimely fate for men grant to lovely maidens life with a husband you that have the rightful power
you divine fates our sisters by one mother divinities who distribute justly who have a share in every home and whose righteous visitations press heavily at every season
most honored everywhere among the gods
athena
i am glad that they are zealously accomplishing these things for my land and i am grateful to persuasion
that her glance kept watch over my tongue and mouth when i encountered their fierce refusal but zeus of the assembly has prevailed our rivalry in doing good is victorious forever
chorus
i pray that discord greedy for evil may never clamor in this city and may the dust not drink the black blood of its people
and through passion cause ruinous murder for vengeance to the destruction of the state but may they return joy for joy in a spirit of common love
and may they hate with one mind for this is the cure of many an evil in the world
athena
do they not then intend to find the path of good speech from these terrible faces
i see great profit for these citizens for if you always greatly honor with kindness the kindly ones you will surely be preeminent keeping your land and city in the straight path of justice
chorus
farewell farewell in the wealth allotted to you by fate farewell people of the city seated near to zeus the beloved of the beloved maiden learning at last the way of wisdom
the father stands in awe of you since you are under pallas wings
athena
farewell to you also but i must lead the way to show you your dwellings by the sacred light of these your escorts
go and speeding beneath the earth with these solemn sacrifices hold back what is ruinous to the land but send what is profitable for the city to win her victory you who hold the city children of cranaus lead on their way these new dwellers here
may there be good will in the citizens in return for good done to them
chorus
farewell farewell again i repeat all you in the city
both gods and mortals living in pallas city if you duly revere my residence among you you will not blame the chances of life
athena
i approve the words of your invocation and will escort you by the light of gleaming torches to the places below and beneath the earth with the attendant women who guard my image in duty bound
for the eye of the whole land of theseus will come forth a glorious troop of children matrons and a band of old women
dress them honorably in robes dyed scarlet and let the torches light move on so that this kindly company of visitors to our land
may show itself afterwards in blessings that bring prosperity to men
chorus of the processional escort
go on your way to your home children of night mighty lovers of honor children yet aged under kindly escort you who dwell in the land refrain from inauspicious speech
chorus of the processional escort
under the primeval caverns of the earth gaining the high honor of worship and sacrifice all you people refrain from inauspicious speech
chorus of the processional escort
gracious and favorable to the land
come here venerable goddesses with flamefed torch rejoicing as you go cry aloud now in echo to our song
chorus of the processional escort
peace endures for all time between pallas citizens and these new dwellers here
zeus who sees all and fate have come down to lend aid cry aloud now in echo to our songexeunt omnes
