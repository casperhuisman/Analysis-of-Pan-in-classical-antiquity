dionysus
i the son of zeus have come to this land of the thebans dionysus whom once semele kadmos daughter bore delivered by a lightningbearing flame and having taken a mortal form instead of a gods
i am here at the fountains of dirke and the water of ismenus and i see the tomb of my thunderstricken mother here near the palace and the remnants of her house smouldering with the still living flame of zeus fire the everlasting insult of hera against my mother
i praise kadmos who has made this place hallowed the shrine of his daughter and i have covered it all around with the clusterbearing leaf of the vine
i have left the wealthy lands of the lydians and phrygians the sunparched plains of the persians
and the bactrian walls and have passed over the wintry land of the medes and blessed arabia and all of asia which lies along the coast of the salt sea with its beautifullytowered cities full of hellenes and barbarians mingled together
and i have come to this hellene city first having already set those other lands to dance and established my mysteries there so that i might be a deity manifest among men in this land of hellas i have first excited thebes to my cry fitting a fawnskin to my body and
taking a thyrsos in my hand a weapon of ivy for my mothers sisters the ones who least should claimed that i dionysus was not the child of zeus but that semele had conceived a child from a mortal father and then ascribed the sin of her bed to zeus
a trick of kadmos for which they boasted that zeus killed her because she had told a false tale about her marriage therefore i have goaded them from the house in frenzy and they dwell in the mountains out of their wits and i have compelled them to wear the outfit of my mysteries
and all the female offspring of thebes as many as are women i have driven maddened from the house and they mingled with the daughters of kadmos sit on roofless rocks beneath green pines for this city must learn even if it is unwilling
that it is not initiated into my bacchic rites and that i plead the case of my mother semele in appearing manifest to mortals as a divinity whom she bore to zeus
now kadmos has given his honor and power to pentheus his daughters son
who fights against the gods as far as i am concerned and drives me away from sacrifices and in his prayers makes no mention of me for which i will show him and all the thebans that i was born a god and when i have set matters here right i will move on to another land
revealing myself but if ever the city of thebes should in anger seek to drive the the bacchae down from the mountains with arms i the general of the maenads will join battle with them on which account i have changed my form to a mortal one and altered my shape into the nature of a man
but you women who have left tmolus the bulwark of lydia my sacred band whom i have brought from among the barbarians as assistants and companions to me take your drums native instruments of the city of the phrygians the invention of mother rhea and myself
and going about this palace of pentheus beat them so that kadmos city may see i myself will go to the folds of kithairon where the bacchae are to share in their dances
chorus
from the land of asia
having left sacred tmolus i am swift to perform for bromius my sweet labor and toil easily borne celebrating the god bacchus who is in the way who is in the way who let him get out of the way indoors and let everyone keep his mouth pure
speaking propitious things for i will celebrate dionysus with hymns according to eternal custom
chorus
blessed is he who being fortunate and knowing the rites of the gods keeps his life pure and
has his soul initiated into the bacchic revels dancing in inspired frenzy over the mountains with holy purifications and who revering the mysteries of great mother kybele
brandishing the thyrsos garlanded with ivy serves dionysus
go bacchae go bacchae escorting the god bromius child of a god
from the phrygian mountains to the broad streets of hellas bromius
chorus
whom once in the compulsion of birth pains
the thunder of zeus flying upon her his mother cast from her womb leaving life by the stroke of a thunderbolt immediately zeus kronos son
received him in a chamber fit for birth and having covered him in his thigh shut him up with golden clasps hidden from hera
and he brought forth when the fates
had perfected him the bullhorned god and he crowned him with crowns of snakes for which reason maenads cloak their wild prey over their locks
chorus
o thebes nurse of semele crown yourself with ivy flourish flourish with the verdant yew bearing sweet fruit and crown yourself in honor of bacchus with branches of oak
or pine adorn your garments of spotted fawnskin with fleeces of white sheep and sport in holy games with insolent thyrsoi  at once all the earth will dance
whoever leads the sacred band is bromius to the mountain to the mountain where the crowd of women waits goaded away from their weaving by dionysus
chorus
o secret chamber of the kouretes and you holy cretan caves parents to zeus where the korybantes with triple helmet invented for me in their caves this circle
covered with stretched hide and in their excited revelry they mingled it with the sweetvoiced breath of phrygian pipes and handed it over to mother rhea resounding with the sweet songs of the bacchae
nearby raving satyrs were fulfilling the rites of the mother goddess and they joined it to the dances of the biennial festivals in which dionysus rejoices
chorus
he is sweet in the mountains  whenever after the running dance he falls on the ground wearing the sacred garment of fawn skin hunting the blood of the slain goat a raweaten delight rushing to the
phrygian the lydian mountains and the leader of the dance is bromius evoe  the plain flows with milk it flows with wine it flows with the nectar of bees
the bacchic one raising the flaming torch of pine on his thyrsos like the smoke of syrian incense darts about arousing the wanderers with his racing and dancing agitating them with his shouts
casting his rich locks into the air and among the maenad cries his voice rings deep  go bacchae go bacchae with the luxury of tmolus that flows with gold
sing of dionysus beneath the heavy beat of drums celebrating in delight the god of delight with phrygian shouts and cries
when the sweetsounding sacred pipe sounds a sacred playful tune suited
to the wanderers to the mountain to the mountain and the bacchante rejoicing like a foal with its grazing mother rouses her swift foot in a gamboling dance
teiresias
who is at the gates call from the house kadmos son of agenor who leaving the city of sidon built this towering city of the thebans let someone go and announce that teiresias is looking for him he knows why i have come and
what agreement i an old man have made with him older still to twine the thyrsoi to wear fawnskins and to crown our heads with ivy branches
kadmos
dearest friend for inside the house i heard and recognized your wise voice the voice of a wise man
i have come prepared with this equipment of the god for we must extol him the child of my daughter dionysus who has appeared as a god to men as much as is in our power where must i dance where set my feet
and shake my grey head show me the way teiresias one old man leading another for you are wise and so i shall never tire night or day striking the ground with the thyrsos gladly i have forgotten that i am old
teiresias
then you and i have the same feelings
for i too feel young and will try to dance
kadmos
then will we go to the mountain in a chariot
teiresias
but then the god would not have equal honor
kadmos
i an old man will lead you an old man like a pupil
teiresias
the god will lead us there without trouble
kadmos
are we the only ones in the city who will dance in bacchus honor
teiresias
yes for we alone think rightly the rest wrongly
kadmos
the delay is long come take hold of my hand
teiresias
here take hold and join your hand with mine
kadmos
having been born mortal i do not scorn the gods
teiresias
we mortals have no cleverness in the eyes of the the gods our ancestral traditions and those which we have held throughout our lives no argument will overturn not even if some craftiness should be discovered by the depths of our wits  will anyone say that i do not respect old age
being about to dance with my head covered in ivy no for the god has made no distinction as to whether it is right for men young or old to dance but wishes to have common honors from all and to be extolled setting no one apart
kadmos
since you do not see this light teiresias i will be your interpreter pentheus child of echion to whom i gave control of this land is coming here to the house now in haste how fluttered he is what new matter will he tell us
pentheus
i happened to be at a distance from this land when i heard of strange evils throughout this city that the women have left our homes in contrived bacchic rites and rush about in the shadowy mountains honoring with dances
this new deity dionysus whoever he is i hear that mixingbowls stand full in the midst of their assemblies and that they each creep off different ways into secrecy to serve the beds of men on the pretext that they are maenads worshipping
but they consider aphrodite before bacchus
as many of them as i have caught servants keep in the public strongholds with their hands bound and as many as are absent i will hunt from the mountains i mean ino and agave who bore me to echion and
autonoe the mother of actaeon and having bound them in iron fetters i will soon stop them from this illworking revelry and they say that some stranger has come a sorcerer a conjuror from the lydian land
fragrant in hair with golden curls having in his eyes the winedark graces of aphrodite he is with the young girls day and night alluring them with joyful mysteries if i catch him within this house
i will stop him from making a noise with the thyrsos and shaking his hair by cutting his head off
that one claims that dionysus is a god claims that he was once stitched into the thigh of zeus dionysus who was burnt up with his mother by the flame of lightning
because she had falsely claimed a marriage with zeus is this not worthy of a terrible death by hanging for a stranger to insult me with these insults whoever he is
but here is another wonder i see teiresias the soothsayer in dappled fawnskins
and my mothers father a great absurdity raging about with a thyrsos i shrink father from seeing your old age devoid of sense wont you cast away the ivy grandfather will you not free your hand of the thyrsos
you persuaded him to this teiresias do you wish by introducing another new god to men to examine birds and receive rewards for sacrifices if your gray old age did not defend you you would sit in chains in the midst of the bacchae
for introducing wicked rites for where women have the delight of the grapecluster at a feast i say that none of their rites is healthy any longer
chorus leader
oh what impiety o stranger do you not reverence the gods and kadmos who sowed the earthborn crop
do you the child of echion bring shame to your race
teiresias
teiresias
whenever a wise man takes a good occasion for his speech it is not a great task to speak well you have a rapid tongue as though you were sensible but there is no sense in your words
a man powerful in his boldness one capable of speaking well becomes a bad citizen in his lack of sense this new god whom you ridicule i am unable to express how great he will be throughout hellas for two things young man
are first among men the goddess demeter she is the earth but call her whatever name you wish she nourishes mortals with dry food but he who came afterwards the offspring of semele discovered a match to it the liquid drink of the grape and introduced it
to mortals it releases wretched mortals from grief whenever they are filled with the stream of the vine and gives them sleep a means of forgetting their daily troubles nor is there another cure for hardships he who is a god is poured out in offerings to the gods
so that by his means men may have good things
and do you laugh at him because he was sewn up in zeus thigh i will teach you that this is well when zeus snatched him out of the lightingflame and led the child as a god to olympus
hera wished to banish him from the sky but zeus as a god had a countercontrivance having broken a part of the air which surrounds the earth he gave this to hera as a pledge protecting the real dionysus from her hostility but in time
mortals say that he was nourished in the thigh of zeus changing the word because a god he had served as a hostage for the goddess hera and composing the story
but this god is a prophet for bacchic revelry and madness have in them much prophetic skill
for whenever the god enters a body in full force he makes the frantic to foretell the future he also possesses a share of ares nature for terror sometimes flutters an army under arms and in its ranks before it even touches a spear
and this too is a frenzy from dionysus you will see him also on the rocks of delphi bounding with torches through the highland of two peaks leaping and shaking the bacchic branch mighty throughout hellas but believe me pentheus
do not boast that sovereignty has power among men nor even if you think so and your mind is diseased believe that you are being at all wise receive the god into your land pour libations to him celebrate the bacchic rites and garland your head
dionysus will not compel women
to be modest in regard to aphrodite but in nature modesty dwells always you must look for that for she who is modest will not be corrupted in bacchic revelry do you see you rejoice whenever many people are at your gates
and the city extols the name of pentheus he too i think delights in being honored kadmos whom you mock and i will crown our heads with ivy and dance a gray yoketeam but still we must dance
and i will not be persuaded by your words to fight against the god for you are mad in a most grievous way and you will not be cured by drugs nor are you sick without them
chorus leader
old man you do not shame phoebus with your words and honoring dionysus a great god you are prudent
kadmos
my child teiresias has advised you well dwell with us not apart from the laws for now you flit about and have thoughts without thinking even if as you say he is not a god call him one and tell a glorious falsehood
so that semele might seem to have borne a god and honor might come to all our race you see the wretched fate of actaeon who was torn apart in the meadows by the bloodthirsty hounds he had raised
having boasted that he was superior in the hunt to artemis may you not suffer this come let me crown your head with ivy honor the god along with us
pentheus
dont lay a hand on me go off and hold your revels but dont wipe your foolishness off on me i will seek the punishment of this
teacher of your folly let someone go quickly to the seat where he watches the flights of birds upset and overturn it with levers turning everything upside down
and release his garlands to the winds and storms in this way i will especially wound him and some of you hunt throughout the city for this effeminate stranger who introduces a new disease to women and pollutes our beds
if you catch him bring him here bound so that he might suffer as punishment a death by stoning having seen a bitter bacchic revelry in thebes
teiresias
o wretched man how little you know what you are saying you are mad now and even before you were out of your wits
let us go kadmos and entreat the god on behalf of him though he is savage and on behalf of the city to do no ill but follow me with the ivyclad staff and try to support my body and i will try to support yours
it would be shameful for two old men to fall down but let that pass for we must serve bacchus the son of zeus beware lest pentheus bring trouble to your house kadmos i do not speak in prophecy but judging from the state of things for a foolish man speaks foolishness
chorus
holiness queen of the gods holiness who bear your golden wings along the earth do you hear these words from pentheus do you hear his unholy
insolence against bromius the child of semele the first deity of the gods at the banquets where guests wear beautiful garlands he holds this office to join in dances
to laugh with the flute and to bring an end to cares whenever the delight of the grape comes at the feasts of the gods and in ivybearing banquets
the goblet sheds sleep over men
chorus
misfortune is the result of unbridled mouths and lawless folly but the life of quiet
and wisdom remain unshaken and hold houses together though they dwell far off in the heavens the gods see the deeds of mortals
but cleverness is not wisdom nor is thinking on things unfit for mortals life is short and on this account the one who pursues great things does not achieve that which is present in my opinion
these are the ways of mad and illadvised men
chorus
would that i could go to cyprus the island of aphrodite where the loves who soothe
mortals hearts dwell and to paphos fertilized without rain by the streams of a foreign river flowing with a hundred mouths lead me there bromius bromius god of joy who leads the bacchae
to pieria beautiful seat of the muses the holy slope of olympus there are the graces there is desire there it is
lawful for the bacchae to celebrate their rites
chorus
the god the son of zeus delights in banquets and loves peace giver of riches
goddess who nourishes youths to the blessed and to the less fortunate he gives an equal pleasure from wine that banishes grief he hates the one who does not care about this
to lead a happy life by day and friendly  night and to keep his wise mind and intellect away from overcurious men
what the common people think and adopt that would i accept
enter a servant
servant
pentheus we are here having caught this prey
for which you sent us nor have we set out in vain this beast was docile in our hands and did not withdraw in flight but yielded not unwillingly he did not turn pale or change the winedark complexion of his cheek but laughed and allowed us to bind him and lead him away
he remained still making my work easy and i in shame said stranger i do not lead you away willingly but by order of pentheus who sent me
and the bacchae whom you shut up whom you carried off and bound in the chains of the public prison
are set loose and gone and are gamboling in the meadows invoking bromius as their god of their own accord the chains were loosed from their feet and keys opened the doors without human hand this man has come to thebes
full of many wonders you must take care of the rest
pentheus
release his hands for caught in the nets he is not so swift as to escape me but your body is not illformed stranger for womens purposes for which reason you have come to thebes
for your hair is long not through wrestling scattered over your cheeks full of desire and you have a white skin from careful preparation hunting after aphrodite by your beauty not exposed to strokes of the sun but beneath the shade
first then tell me who your family is
dionysus
i can tell you this easily without boasting i suppose you are familiar with flowery tmolus
pentheus
i know of it it surrounds the city of sardis
dionysus
i am from there and lydia is my fatherland
pentheus
why do you bring these rites to hellas
dionysus
dionysus the child of zeus sent me
pentheus
is there a zeus who breeds new gods there
dionysus
no but the one who married semele here
pentheus
did he compel you at night or in your sight
dionysus
seeing me just as i saw him he gave me sacred rites
pentheus
what appearance do your rites have
dionysus
they can not be told to mortals uninitiated in bacchic revelry
pentheus
and do they have any profit to those who sacrifice
dionysus
it is not lawful for you to hear but they are worth knowing
pentheus
you have counterfeited this well so that i desire to hear
dionysus
the rites are hostile to whoever practices impiety
pentheus
are you saying that you saw clearly what the god was like
dionysus
he was as he chose i did not order this
pentheus
again you diverted my question well speaking mere nonsense
dionysus
one will seem to be foolish if he speaks wisely to an ignorant man
pentheus
did you come here first bringing the god
dionysus
all the barbarians celebrate these rites
pentheus
yes for they are far more foolish than hellenes
dionysus
in this at any rate they are wiser but their laws are different
pentheus
do you perform the rites by night or by day
dionysus
mostly by night darkness conveys awe
pentheus
this is treacherous towards women and unsound
dionysus
even during the day someone may devise what is shameful
pentheus
you must pay the penalty for your evil contrivances
dionysus
and you for your ignorance and impiety toward the god
pentheus
how bold the bacchant is and not unpracticed in speaking
dionysus
tell me what i must suffer what harm will you do to me
pentheus
first i will cut off your delicate hair
dionysus
my hair is sacred i am growing it for the god
pentheus
next give me this thyrsos from your hands
dionysus
take it from me yourself i bear it as the ensign of dionysus
pentheus
we will guard your body within in prison
dionysus
the god himself will release me whenever i want
pentheus
yes when you call him standing among the bacchae
dionysus
even now he see my sufferings from close by
pentheus
where is he he is not visible to my eyes
dionysus
near me but you being impious do not see him
pentheus
to attendants
seize him he insults me and thebes
dionysus
i warn you not to bind me since i am in my senses and you are not
pentheus
and i more masterful than you bid them to bind you
dionysus
you do not know why you live or what you are doing or who you are
pentheus
i am pentheus son of echion and agave
dionysus
you are wellsuited to be miserable in your name
pentheus
go
to attendants
shut him up near the horse
stable so that he may see only darkness
to dionysus
dance there and as for these women whom you have led here as accomplices to your crimes we will either sell them or stopping their hands from this noise and beating of skins i will keep them as slaves at the loom
dionysus
i will go for i need not suffer that which is not necessary but dionysus who you claim does not exist will pursue you for these insults for in injuring us you put him in bonds
chorus
daughter of achelous
venerable dirce happy virgin you once received the child of zeus in your streams when zeus his father snatched him up from the immortal fire and saved him in his thigh
crying out go dithyrambus enter this my male womb i will make you illustrious bacchus in thebes so that they will call you by this name
but you blessed dirce reject me with my garlandbearing company about you why do you refuse me why do you flee me i swear by the clusterbearing
delight of dionysus vine that you will have a care for bromius
chorus
what rage what rage does the earthborn race show and pentheus
once descended from a serpent pentheus whom earthborn echion bore a fierce monster not a mortal man but like a bloody giant hostile to the gods
he will soon bind me the handmaid of bromius in chains and he already holds my fellowreveler within the house hidden in a dark prison
do you see this o dionysus son of zeus your priests in the dangers of restraint come lord down from olympus brandishing your golden thyrsos
and restrain the insolence of the bloodthirsty man
chorus
where on nysa which nourishes wild beasts or on corycian heights do you lead with your thyrsos the bands of revelers
perhaps in the deepwooded lairs of olympus where orpheus once playing the lyre drew together trees by his songs drew together the beasts of the fields
blessed pieria the joyful one reveres you and will come to lead the dance in revelry having crossed the swiftly flowing axius he will bring the
whirling maenads leaving lydias giver of wealth to mortals the father who they say fertilizes the land of beautiful horses with
fairest streams
dionysus
within
io hear my voice hear it io bacchae io bacchae
chorus
who is here who from what quarter did the voice of the joyful one summon me
dionysus
io io i say again it is i the child of zeus and semele
chorus
io io master master come now to our company bromius
dionysus
shake the worlds plain lady earthquake
chorus
oh oh soon the palace of pentheus will be shaken in ruin
dionysus is in the halls
revere him
we revere him
did you see these stone lintels on the pillars falling apart bromius cries out in victory indoors
dionysus
light the fiery lamp of lightning
burn burn pentheus home
chorus
oh oh do you not see the the fire do you not perceive about the sacred tomb of semele the flame that zeus thunderbolt left
cast on the ground your trembling bodies maenads cast them down for our lord zeus son is coming against this palace turning everything upside down
enter dionysus
dionysus
barbarian women have you fallen on the ground
so stricken with fear you have so it seems felt bacchus shaking the house of pentheus but get up and take courage putting a stop to your trembling
chorus leader
oh greatest light for us in our joyful revelry how happy i am to see you i who was alone and desolate before
dionysus
did you despair when i was sent to fall into pentheus dark dungeon
chorus leader
how not who was my guardian if you met with misfortune but how were you freed having met with an impious man
dionysus
by myself i saved myself easily without trouble
chorus leader
did he not tie your hands in binding knots
dionysus
in this too i mocked him for thinking to bind me he neither touched nor handled me but fed on hope he found a bull by the stable where he took and shut me up and threw shackles around its knees and hooves
breathing out fury dripping sweat from his body gnashing his teeth in his lips but i being near sitting quietly looked on meanwhile bacchus came and shook the house and kindled a flame on his mothers tomb when pentheus saw this thinking that the house was burning
he ran here and there calling to the slaves to bring water and every servant was at work toiling in vain
then he let this labor drop as i had escaped and snatching a dark sword rushed into the house then bromius so it seems to me i speak my opinion
created a phantom in the courtyard pentheus rushed at it headlong stabbing at the shining air as though slaughtering me besides this bacchus inflicted other damage on him he knocked his house to the ground and everything was shattered into pieces while he saw my bitter chains from fatigue
dropping his sword he is exhausted for he a man dared to join battle with a god now i have quietly left the house and come to you with no thought of pentheus
but i think at any rate i hear the tramping of feet inside he will soon come to the front of the house what will he say after this
i shall easily bear him even if he comes boasting greatly for it is the part of a wise man to practice restrained good temper
enter pentheus
pentheus
i have suffered terrible things the stranger who was recently constrained in bonds has escaped me ah
here is the man what is this how do you appear in front of my house having come out
dionysus
stop and put a stop to your anger
pentheus
how have you escaped your chains and come outside
dionysus
did i not say or did you not hear that some one would deliver me
pentheus
who you are always introducing strange explanations
dionysus
he who produces the richclustering vine for mortals
pentheus
dionysus
you reproach dionysus for what is his glory
pentheus
i order you to close up all the towers around
dionysus
why do gods not pass over walls too
pentheus
you are wise wise at least in all save what you should be wise in
dionysus
i was born wise in all that i should be
enter a messenger
listen first to the words of this man who has come from the mountain to bring you some message i will await you i will not try to escape
messenger
pentheus ruler of this land of thebes i have come from kithairon where the bright flakes of white snow never melt
pentheus
what important news do you come to bring
messenger
having seen the holy bacchae who
goaded to madness have darted from this land with their fair feet i have come to tell you and the city lord that they are doing terrible things beyond marvel i wish to hear whether i should tell you in free speech the situation there or whether i should repress my report
for i fear lord the quickness of your mood your keen temper and your too imperious disposition
pentheus
speak as you will have immunity from me in any case for it is not right to be angry with the just the more you tell me terrible things about the bacchae
the more i will punish this one here who taught the women these tricks
messenger
messenger
the herds of grazing cattle were just climbing up the hill at the time when the sun sends forth its rays warming the earth
i saw three companies of dancing women one of which autonoe led the second your mother agave and the third ino all were asleep their bodies relaxed some resting their backs against pine foliage
others laying their heads at random on the oak leaves modestly not as you say drunk with the goblet and the sound of the flute hunting out aphrodite through the woods in solitude
your mother raised a cry
standing up in the midst of the bacchae to wake their bodies from sleep when she heard the lowing of the horned cattle and they casting off refreshing sleep from their eyes sprang upright a marvel of orderliness to behold old young and still unmarried virgins
first they let their hair loose over their shoulders and secured their fawnskins as many of them as had released the fastenings of their knots girding the dappled hides with serpents licking their jaws and some holding in their arms a gazelle or wild
wolfpup gave them white milk as many as had abandoned their newborn infants and had their breasts still swollen they put on garlands of ivy and oak and flowering yew one took her thyrsos and struck it against a rock
from which a dewy stream of water sprang forth another let her thyrsos strike the ground and there the god sent forth a fountain of wine all who desired the white drink scratched the earth with the tips of their fingers and obtained streams of milk
and a sweet flow of honey dripped from their ivy thyrsoi so that had you been present and seen this you would have approached with prayers the god whom you now blame
we herdsmen and shepherds gathered in order to
debate with one another concerning what strange and amazing things they were doing some one a wanderer about the city and practised in speaking said to us all you who inhabit the holy plains of the mountains do you wish to hunt
pentheus mother agave out from the bacchic revelry and do the king a favor we thought he spoke well and lay down in ambush hiding ourselves in the foliage of bushes they at the appointed hour began to wave the thyrsos in their revelries
calling on iacchus the son of zeus bromius with united voice the whole mountain revelled along with them and the beasts and nothing was unmoved by their running
agave happened to be leaping near me and i sprang forth wanting to snatch her
abandoning the ambush where i had hidden myself but she cried out o my fleet hounds we are hunted by these men but follow me follow armed with your thyrsoi in your hands
we fled and escaped
from being torn apart by the bacchae but they with unarmed hands sprang on the heifers browsing the grass and you might see one rending asunder a fatted lowing calf while others tore apart cows
you might see ribs or cloven hooves tossed here and there caught in the trees they dripped dabbled in gore bulls who before were fierce and showed their fury with their horns stumbled to the ground
dragged down by countless young hands the garment of flesh was torn apart faster then you could blink your royal eyes and like birds raised in their course they proceeded along the level plains which by the streams of the asopus
produce the bountiful theban crop and falling like soldiers upon hysiae and erythrae towns situated below the rock of kithairon they turned everything upside down they were snatching children from their homes
and whatever they put on their shoulders whether bronze or iron was not held on by bonds nor did it fall to the ground they carried fire on their locks but it did not burn them some people in rage took up arms being plundered by the bacchae
and the sight of this was terrible to behold lord for their pointed spears drew no blood but the women hurling the thyrsoi from their hands kept wounding them and turned them to flight women did this to men not without the help of some god
and they returned where they had come from to the very fountains which the god had sent forth for them and washed off the blood and snakes cleaned the drops from the womens cheeks with their tongues
receive this god then whoever he is
into this city master for he is great in other respects and they say this too of him as i hear that he gives to mortals the vine that puts an end to grief without wine there is no longer aphrodite or any other pleasant thing for men
chorus leader
i fear to speak freely to the king but i will speak nevertheless dionysus is inferior to none of the gods
pentheus
already like fire does this insolence of the bacchae blaze up a great reproach for the hellenes
but we must not hesitate go to the electran gates bid all the shieldbearers and riders of swiftfooted horses to assemble as well as all who brandish the light shield and pluck bowstrings with their hands so that we can make an assault against
the bacchae for it is indeed too much if we suffer what we are suffering at the hands of women
dionysus
pentheus though you hear my words you obey not at all though i suffer ill at your hands still i say that it is not right for you to raise arms against a god
but to remain calm bromius will not allow you to remove the bacchae from the joyful mountains
pentheus
do not instruct me but be content in your escape from prison or shall i bring punishment upon you again
dionysus
i would sacrifice to the god rather
than kick against his spurs in anger a mortal against a god
pentheus
i will sacrifice making a great slaughter of the women as they deserve in the glens of kithairon
dionysus
you will all flee and it will be a source of shame that you turn your bronze shields away from the thyrsoi of the bacchae
pentheus
this stranger with whom i am locked together is impossible and neither suffering nor doing will he be quiet
dionysus
my friend there is still opportunity to arrange these things well
pentheus
doing what being a slave to my slaves
dionysus
without weapons i will bring the women here
pentheus
alas you are contriving this as a trick against me
dionysus
what sort if i wish to save you by my contrivances
pentheus
you have devised this together so that you may have your revelry forever
dionysus
i certainly did that is so with the god
pentheus
to a servant
bring me my armor to dionysus  and you stop speaking
dionysus
ah do you wish to see them sitting together in the mountains
pentheus
certainly id give an enormous amount of gold for that
dionysus
why do you desire this so badly
pentheus
i would be sorry to see them in their drunkenness
dionysus
but would you see gladly what is grievous to you
pentheus
to be sure sitting quietly under the pines
dionysus
but they will track you down even if you go in secret
pentheus
you are right i will go openly
dionysus
shall i guide you will you attempt the journey
pentheus
lead me as quickly as possible i grudge you the time
dionysus
put linen clothes on your body then
pentheus
what is this shall i then instead of a man be reckoned among the women
dionysus
lest they kill you if you are seen there as a man
pentheus
again you speak correctly how wise you have been all along
dionysus
dionysus taught me these things fully
pentheus
how can your advice to me be well carried out
dionysus
i will go inside and dress you
pentheus
in what clothing female but shame holds me back
dionysus
are you no longer eager to view the maenads
pentheus
what clothing do you bid me to put on my body
dionysus
i will spread out hair at length on your head
pentheus
what is the second part of my outfit
dionysus
a robe down to your feet and you will wear a headband
pentheus
and what else will you add to this for me
dionysus
a thyrsos in your hand and a dappled fawnskin
pentheus
i could not put on a womans dress
dionysus
but you will shed blood if you join battle with the bacchae
pentheus
true we must go first and spy
dionysus
this is at any rate wiser than hunting trouble with trouble
pentheus
and how will i go through the city without being seen by the thebans
dionysus
we will go on deserted roads i will lead you
pentheus
anything is better than to be mocked by the bacchae we two will go into the house    and i will consider what seems best
dionysus
it will be so in any case i am ready
pentheus
i will go in for either i will go bearing arms or i will obey your counsels
dionysus
women the man is caught in our net he will go to the bacchae where he will pay the penalty with his death dionysus now it is your job for you are not far off
let us punish him first drive him out of his wits send upon him a dizzying madness since if he is of sound mind he will not consent to wear womens clothing but driven out of his senses he will put it on i want him to be a source of laughter to the thebans led through the city in
womens guise after making such terrible threats in the past but now i will go to fit on pentheus the dress he will wear to the house of hades slaughtered by his mothers hands he will recognize the son of zeus
dionysus who is in fact a god the most terrible and yet most mild to men
chorus
shall i move my white foot in the nightlong dance aroused to a frenzy
throwing my head to the dewy air like a fawn sporting in the green pleasures of the meadow when it has escaped a fearful chase beyond the watchers
over the wellwoven nets and the hunter hastens his dogs on their course with his call while she with great exertion and a stormswift running rushes along the plain by the river rejoicing
in the solitude apart from men and in the thickets of the shadyfoliaged woods
what is wisdom or what greater honor do the gods give to mortals than to hold ones hand
in strength over the head of enemies what is good is always dear
chorus
divine strength is roused with difficulty but still is sure it chastises those mortals
who honor folly and those who in their insanity do not extol the gods the gods cunningly conceal the long pace of time and
hunt the impious for it is not right to determine or plan anything beyond the laws for it is a light expense to hold that whatever is divine has power
and that which has been law for a long time is eternal and has its origin in nature
what is wisdom or what greater honor do the gods give to mortals than to hold ones hand
in strength over the head of enemies what is good is always dear
chorus
happy is he  who has fled a storm on the sea and reached harbor happy too is he who has overcome his hardships
one surpass another in different ways in wealth or power there are innumerable hopes to innumerable men and some result in wealth to mortals while others fail
but i call him blessed whose life is happy day to day
dionysus
you who are eager to see what you ought not and hasty in pursuit of what ought not to be pursued i mean you pentheus come forth before the house be seen by me
wearing the clothing of a woman of an inspired maenad a spy upon your mother and her company
pentheus emerges
in appearance you are like one of kadmos daughters
pentheus
oh look i think i see two suns and twin thebes the sevengated city
and you seem to lead me being like a bull and horns seem to grow on your head but were you ever before a beast for you have certainly now become a bull
dionysus
the god accompanies us now at truce with us though formerly not propitious now you see what you should see
pentheus
how do i look dont i have the posture of ino or of my mother agave
dionysus
looking at you i think i see them but this lock of your hair has come out of place not the way i arranged it under your headband
pentheus
i displaced it indoors shaking my head forwards and backwards and practising my bacchic revelry
dionysus
but i who ought to wait on you will rearrange it hold up your head
pentheus
here you arrange it for i depend on you indeed
dionysus
your girdle has come loose and the pleats of your gown do not extend regularly down around your ankles
pentheus
at least on my right leg i believe they dont but on this side the robe sits well around the back of my leg
dionysus
you will surely consider me the best of your friends
when contrary to your expectation you see the bacchae acting modestly
pentheus
but shall i be more like a maenad holding the thyrsos in my right hand or in my left
dionysus
you must hold it in your right hand and raise your right foot in unison with it i praise you for having changed your mind
pentheus
could i carry on my shoulders the glens of kithairon bacchae and all
dionysus
you could if you were willing the state of mind you had before was unsound but now you think as you ought
pentheus
shall we bring levers or shall i draw them up with my hands
putting a shoulder or arm under the mountaintops
dionysus
but dont destroy the seats of the nymphs and the places where pan plays his pipes
pentheus
well said the women are not to be taken by force i will hide in the pines
dionysus
you will hide yourself as you should be hidden coming as a crafty spy on the maenads
pentheus
oh yes i imagine that like birds they are in the bushes held in the sweetest grips of love
dionysus
you have been sent as a guard against this very event
perhaps you will catch them if you yourself are not caught before
pentheus
bring me through the midst of the theban land i am the only man of them who dares to perform this deed
dionysus
you alone bear the burden for this city you alone therefore the labors which are proper await you
follow me i am your saving guide another will lead you down from there
pentheus
yes my mother
dionysus
and you will be remarkable to all
pentheus
i am going for this reason
dionysus
you will return here being carried
pentheus
you talk of a delicacy for me
dionysus
in the arms of your mother
pentheus
you will force me to luxury
dionysus
yes indeed such luxury
pentheus
i will get what i deserve
dionysus
you are terrible terrible and you go to terrible sufferings so that you will find a renown reaching to heaven reach out your hands agave and you too her sisters daughters of kadmos i lead this young man
to a great contest and bromius and i will be the victors the rest the matter itself will show
chorus
go to the mountain go fleet hounds of madness where the daughters of kadmos hold their company and drive them raving
against the mad spy on the maenads the one dressed in womens attire his mother will be the first to see him from a smooth rock or crag as he lies in ambush and she will cry out to the maenads
who is this seeker of the mountaingoing kadmeans who has come to the mountain to the mountain bacchae who bore him for he was not born from a womans blood but is the offspring of some lioness
or of libyan gorgons
let manifest justice go forth let it go with sword in hand slaying through the throat
this godless lawless unjust earthborn offspring of echion
chorus
whoever with wicked mind and unjust rage regarding your rites bacchus and those of your mother comes with raving heart
and mad disposition violently to overcome by force what is invincible death is the discipline for his purposes accepting no excuses when the affairs of the gods are concerned to act like a mortal this is a life that is free from pain
i do not envy wisdom but rejoice in hunting it but other things are great and manifest oh for life to flow towards the good to be pure and pious day and night and to honor the gods
banishing customs that are outside of justice
let manifest justice go forth let it go with sword in hand slaying through the throat
this godless lawless unjust earthborn offspring of echion
chorus
appear as a bull or manyheaded serpent or raging lion to see
go bacchus with smiling face throw a deadly noose around the hunter of the bacchae as he falls beneath the flock of maenads
second messenger
oh house once fortunate in hellas
house of the sidonian old man who once sowed in the ground the earthborn harvest of the serpent ophis how i groan for you though i am a slave but still the masters affairs are a concern to good servants
chorus leader
what is it do you bring some news from the bacchae
messenger
pentheus the child of echion is dead
sung
chorus leader
lord bacchus truly you appear to be a great god
messenger
what do you mean why have you said this do you rejoice at the misfortunes of my master woman

messenger

sung
chorus leader

messenger
you may be forgiven but still it is not good
to rejoice at troubles once they have actually taken place women

messenger
when we left the dwellings of the theban land and crossed the streams of asopus
we began to ascend the heights of kithairon pentheus and i for i was following my master and the stranger who was our guide to the sight first we sat in a grassy vale
keeping our feet and voices quiet so that we might see them without being seen there was a little valley surounded by precipices irrigated with streams shaded by pine trees where the maenads were sitting their hands busy with delightful labors some of them were crowning again
the worn thyrsos making it leafy with ivy while some like colts freed from the painted yoke were singing a bacchic melody to one another and the unhappy pentheus said not seeing the crowd of women stranger
from where we are standing i cannot see these false maenads but on the hill ascending a lofty pine i might view properly the shameful acts of the maenads
and then i saw the stranger perform a marvelous deed for seizing hold of the lofty topmost branch of the pine tree
he pulled it down pulled it pulled it to the dark earth it was bent just as a bow or a curved wheel when it is marked out by a compass describes a circular course  in this way the stranger drew the mountain bough with his hands and bent it to the earth doing no mortals deed
he sat pentheus down on the pine branch and let it go upright through his hands steadily taking care not to shake him off the pine stood firmly upright into the sky with my master seated on its back
he was seen by the maenads more than he saw them for sitting on high he was all but apparent and the stranger was no longer anywhere to be seen when a voice dionysus as i guess cried out from the air young women
i bring the one who has made you and me and my rites a laughingstock now punish him and as he said this a light of holy fire was placed between heaven and earth
the air became quiet and the woody glen
kept its leaves silent nor would you have heard the sounds of animals but they not having heard the sound clearly stood upright and looked all around he repeated his order and when the daughters of kadmos recognized the clear command of bacchus
they rushed forth swift as a dove running with eager speed of feet his mother agave and her sisters and all the bacchae they leapt through the torrentstreaming valley and mountain cliffs frantic with the inspiration of the god
when they saw my master sitting in the pine first they climbed a rock towering opposite the tree and began to hurl at him boulders violently thrown some aimed with pine branches and other women hurled their thyrsoi through the air
at pentheus a sad target indeed but they did not reach him for the wretched man caught with no way out sat at a height too great for their eagerness finally like lightning they smashed oak branches and began to tear up the roots of the tree with ironless levers
when they did not succeed in their toils agave said come standing round in a circle each seize a branch maenads so that we may catch the beast who has climbed aloft and so that he does not make public the secret dances of the god they applied countless hands
to the pine and dragged it up from the earth pentheus fell crashing to the ground from his lofty seat wailing greatly for he knew he was in terrible trouble
his mother as priestess began the slaughter
and fell upon him he threw the headband from his head so that the wretched agave might recognize and not kill him touching her cheek he said it is i mother your son pentheus whom you bore in the house of echion
pity me mother and do not kill me your child for my sins
but she foaming at the mouth and twisting her eyes all about not thinking as she ought was possessed by bacchus and he did not persuade her
seizing his left arm at the elbow and propping her foot against the unfortunate mans side she tore out his shoulder not by her own strength but the god gave facility to her hands ino began to work on the other side
tearing his flesh while autonoe and the whole crowd of the bacchae pressed on all were making noise together he groaning as much as he had life left in him while they shouted in victory one of them bore his arm another a foot boot and all his ribs were stripped bare
from their tearings the whole band hands bloodied were playing a game of catch with pentheus flesh
his body lies in different places part under the rugged rocks part in the deep foliage of the woods not easy to be sought his miserable head
which his mother happened to take in her hands she fixed on the end of a thyrsos and carries through the midst of kithairon like that of a savage lion leaving her sisters among the maenads dances she is coming inside these walls preening herself
on the illfated prey calling bacchus her fellow hunter her accomplice in the chase the glorious victor in whose service she wins a triumph of tears
and as for me i will depart out of the way of this calamity before agave reaches the house
soundness of mind and reverence for the affairs of the gods is best and this i think is the wisest possession for those mortals who adopt it
chorus
let us honor bacchus with the dance let us raise a shout for what has befallen
pentheus descendant of the serpent who assumed female attire and the wand the beautiful thyrsos certain death and a bull was the leader of his calamity
kadmean bacchae you have accomplished a glorious victory but one that brings woe and tears it is a noble contest to cover ones dripping hands with the blood of ones own son
chorus leader
but for i see pentheus mother agave coming home her eyes contorted receive the revel of the god of joy
enter agave
agave

chorus
why do you excite me oh
agave

freshly cut tendril to the house blessed prey

agave
the bull is young his cheek is just growing downy under his softhaired crest
chorus
yes his hair looks like a wild beasts
agave
bacchus a wise huntsman
wisely set the maenads against this beast
chorus
our lord is a hunter
agave
do you praise me
chorus
i praise you
agave
soon the kadmeans
chorus
and your son pentheus too
agave
will praise his mother who has caught this lionlike prey
chorus
extraordinary
agave
and extraordinarily caught
chorus
are you proud
agave
i am delighted for i have performed great yes great and notable deeds on this hunt
chorus leader
now show the citizens wretched woman the booty which you have brought in victory
agave
you who dwell in this fairtowered city of the theban land come to see this prey which we the daughters of kadmos hunted down
not with thonged thessalian javelins or with nets but with the fingers of our white arms and then should huntsmen boast and use in vain the work of spearmakers but we caught and
tore apart the limbs of this beast with our very own hands where is my old father let him approach and where is my son pentheus let him take a ladder and raise its steps against the house so that he can fasten to the triglyphs this
lions head which i have captured and brought here
enter kadmos and his servants carrying the remains of pentheus body
kadmos
follow me carrying the miserable burden of pentheus follow me slaves before the house exhausted from countless searches i am bringing his body for i discovered it in the folds of kithairon
torn apart i picked up nothing in the same place and it was lying in the woods where discovery was difficult for some one told me of my daughters bold deeds when i had already come within the walls of the city on my return from the bacchae with old teiresias
i turned back to the mountain and now bring here my child who was killed by the maenads for i saw autonoe who once bore actaeon to aristaeus and ino with her still mad in the thicket wretched creatures
but some one told me that agave was coming here with bacchic foot and this was correct for i see her no happy sight
agave
father you may make a great boast that you have born daughters the best by far of all
mortals i mean all of us but myself especially who have left my shuttle at the loom and gone on to greater things to catch wild animals with my two hands and having taken him i carry these spoils of honor in my arms as you see
so that they may hang from your house you father receive them in your hands preening yourself in my catch call your friends to a feast for you are blessed blessed now that we have performed these deeds
kadmos
o grief beyond measuring one which i cannot stand to see
that you have performed murder with miserable hands having cast down a fine sacrificial victim to the gods you invite thebes and me to a banquet alas first for your troubles then for my own how justly yet too severely
lord bromius the god has destroyed us though he is a member of our own family
agave
how morose and sullen in its countenance is mans old age i hope that my son is a good hunter taking after his mothers ways when he goes after wild beasts
together with the young men of thebes but all he can do is fight with the gods you must admonish him father who will call him here to my sight so that he may see how lucky i am
kadmos
alas alas when you realize what you have done
you will suffer a terrible pain but if you remain forever in the state you are in now though hardly fortunate you will not imagine that you are unfortunate
agave
but what of these matters is not right or what is painful
kadmos
first cast your eye up to this sky
agave
all right why do you tell me to look at it
kadmos
is it still the same or does it appear to have changed
agave
it is brighter than before and more translucent
kadmos
is your soul still quivering
agave
i dont understand your words i have become somehow
sobered changing from my former state of mind
kadmos
can you hear and respond clearly
agave
yes for i forget what we said before father
kadmos
to whose house did you come in marriage
agave
you gave me as they say to echion the sown man
kadmos
what son did you bear to your husband in the house
agave
pentheus from my union with his father
kadmos
whose head do you hold in your hands
agave
a lions as they who hunted him down said
kadmos
examine it correctly then it takes but little effort to see
agave
ah what do i see what is this that i carry in my hands
kadmos
look at it and learn more clearly
agave
i see the greatest grief wretched that i am
kadmos
does it seem to you to be like a lion
agave
no but i wretched hold the head of pentheus
kadmos
yes much lamented before you recognized him
agave
who killed him how did he come into my hands
kadmos
miserable truth how inopportunely you arrive
agave
tell me my heart leaps at what is to come
kadmos
you and your sisters killed him
agave
where did he die was it here at home or in what place
kadmos
where formerly dogs divided actaeon among themselves
agave
and why did this illfated man go to kithairon
kadmos
he went to mock the god and your revelry
agave
but in what way did we go there
kadmos
you were mad and the whole city was frantic with bacchus
agave
dionysus destroyed us now i understand
kadmos
being insulted with insolence for you did not consider him a god
agave
and where is the body of my dearest child father
kadmos
i have traced it with difficulty and brought it back
agave
are its joints laid properly together
kadmos
agave
what part did pentheus have in my folly
kadmos
he like you did not revere the god who therefore joined all in one ruin both you and this one here and thus destroyed the house and me
who am bereft of my male children and see this offspring of your womb wretched woman most miserably and shamefully slain he was the hope of our line you child who supported the house son of my daughter
an object of fear to the city seeing you no one wished to insult the old man for you would have given a worthy punishment but now i great kadmos who sowed and reaped
a most glorious crop the theban people will be banished from the house without honor dearest of men for though you are dead i still count you among my dearest child no longer will you embrace me calling me grandfather touching my chin with your hand child and
saying who wrongs you old man who dishonors you who vexes and troubles your heart tell me father so that i can punish the one who does you wrong but now i am miserable while you are wretched your mother is pitiful and wretched too are your relatives
if anyone scorns the gods let him look to the death of this man and acknowledge them
chorus leader
i grieve for you kadmos your daughters child has a punishment deserved indeed but grievous to you
agave
father for you see how much my situation has changed
to kadmos
dionysus
changing your form you will become a dragon and your wife harmonia ares daughter whom you though mortal held in marriage will be turned into a beast and will receive in exchange the form of a serpent and as the oracle of zeus says you will drive along with your wife a chariot of heifers ruling over barbarians
you will sack many cities with a force of countless numbers and when they plunder the oracle of apollo they will have a miserable return but ares will protect you and harmonia and will settle your life in the land of the blessed
that is what i dionysus born not from a mortal father but from zeus say and if you had known how to be wise when you did not wish to be you would have acquired zeus son as an ally and would now be happy
kadmos
dionysus we beseech you we have acted injustly
dionysus
you have learned it too late you did not know it when you should have
kadmos
now we know but you go too far against us
dionysus
yes for i a god by birth was insulted by you
kadmos
gods should not resemble mortals in their anger
dionysus
my father zeus approved this long ago
agave
alas a miserable exile has been decreed for us old man
dionysus
why then do you delay what must necessarily be
kadmos
child what a terrible disaster we have all come to unhappy you your sisters and unhappy me i shall reach a foreign land
as an aged immigrant still it is foretold that i shall bring into hellas a motley barbarian army leading their spears i having the fierce nature of a serpent will bring my wife harmonia daughter of ares to the altars and tombs of hellas
i will neither rest from my troubles in my misery nor will i sail over the downward flowing acheron and be at peace
agave
o father i will go into exile deprived of you
kadmos
why do you embrace me with your hands child
like a swan for its exhausted grayhaired parent
agave
for where can i turn banished from my fatherland
kadmos
i do not know child your father is a poor ally
agave
farewell house farewell city of my forefathers in misfortune i leave you
a fugitive from my chamber
kadmos
go now child to the land of aristaeus
agave
i grieve for you father
kadmos
and i for you child and i weep for your sisters
agave
terribly indeed has
lord dionysus brought this misery to your home
dionysus
yes for i suffered terrible things at your hands with my name not honored in thebes
agave
farewell my father
kadmos
farewell unhappy
daughter and yet you cannot easily fare well
agave
lead me escorts where i may take my pitiful sisters as companions to my exile may i go where accursed kithairon may not see me
nor i see kithairon with my eyes nor where a memorial of a thyrsos has been dedicated let these concern other bacchae
chorus
many are the forms of divine things and the gods bring to pass many things unexpectedly
what is expected has not been accomplished but the god has found out a means for doing things unthought of so too has this event turned out
