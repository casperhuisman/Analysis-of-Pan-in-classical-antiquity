enter dionysus on foot dressed in the skin of the nemean lion and the club of heracles in his hand and xanthias heavily laden on a donkey
xanthias
master should i tell one of those usual jokes
which always make the audience laugh
dionysus
by zeus say what you want except im hard pressed
forget that one its really quite annoying
xanthias
nothing else witty either
dionysus
anything but what a strain
xanthias
what then can i say the really funny one
dionysus
of course
go right ahead but dont let me catch you saying this
xanthias
whats that
dionysus
that you must shift your pack to ease yourself
xanthias
well cant i say ive got such a load on me
unless someone takes it off ill bust a gut
dionysus
please dont unless you wish to make me sick
xanthias
so why should i have to carry all this stuff
without doing any of the jokes that phrynichus
and lycis and ameipsias always make
the baggagecarriers say in all their comedies
dionysus
just dont  since when im in the theater
and hear any of these stupid jokes
i go away just older by a year
xanthias
alas poor wretched me  my neck
is really strained but cant crack the joke
dionysus
now is this not outrage and utter insolence
that i myself dionysos son of winejug
must walk and let this fellow ride
so he might feel no pain and bear no burden
xanthias
what i bear no burden
dionysus
how can you bear anything youre  riding
xanthias
but ive got all this
dionysus
how so
xanthias
most heavily
dionysus
the weight you carry isnt it carried by the donkey
xanthias
absolutely not not what im holding and carrying
dionysus
how can you carry for gods sake  when you
yourself are carried by another
xanthias
i dont know but my shoulders sure hard pressed
dionysus
well since you say the donkey doesnt help
suppose you take your turn and carry him
xanthias
unhappy wretch  why didnt i join the navy
then id tell you to whistle a different tune
dionysus
you scoundrel get on down  heres the door
im walking to the first place
i must stop ho porter porter there i say
heracles
who banged the door  like a centaur
someone drove into it  say whats this
dionysus
my boy
xanthias
well what
dionysus
didnt you notice
xanthias
no what
dionysus
how afraid he was
xanthias
that you might lose your mind
heracles
oh by demeter i cant help but laugh
ill bite my lip but still ive got to laugh
dionysus
come here my good man  i need to ask you a favor
heracles
i just cant stifle this laughter
seeing a lions skin thrown over that saffron gown
what does it mean how have club and buskin joined forces
where in the world were you going
dionysus
i was on board of cleisthenes
heracles
and were you at the naval battle
dionysus
yes and we sank some twelve or thirteen hostile ships
heracles
you two
dionysus
aye by apollo
xanthias
and then i woke up
dionysus
and while i was on board reading
the andromeda suddenly a craving
smote my heart youll never guess how strong
heracles
a craving  how big
dionysus
small like molon
heracles
for a woman
dionysus
oh no
heracles
a boy
dionysus
not at all
heracles
a man
dionysus
argh
heracles
you did it with cleisthenes
dionysus
dont make fun brother ive really got it bad
such passionate desire torments me so
heracles
what is it little brother
dionysus
i cant explain
but still ill try to tell you in a riddle
did you ever feel a sudden urge for soup
heracles
soup  yowee  ten thousand times so far
dionysus
have i made it clear or should i try again
heracles
not about the soup i fully comprehend
dionysus
well just so great a wish gnaws at me now
for my euripides
heracles
and dead at that
dionysus
and now no mortal shall persuade me not to
go after him
heracles
what down to hell
dionysus
thats right and lower still if possible
heracles
with what intent
dionysus
i want a clever poet for the race
is now extinct all who survive are bad
heracles
what  isnt iophon alive
dionysus
well hes the only good thing left if hes good at all i dont even know for sure if thats the case
heracles
why dont you bring back sophocles euripides superior if youve really got to take one
dionysus
not before i take iophon aside all by himself
and test what he does without sophocles besides euripides is such a scoundrel
he might well try to run away with me
but sophocles was easy going here and easy going there as well
heracles
and where is agathon
dionysus
oh he has left us
a decent poet lamented by his friends
heracles
where has he gone
dionysus
to the banquet of the blest
heracles
and wheres xenoclees
dionysus
oh god may he drop dead
heracles
what of pythangelus
xanthias
no word of me
long suffering with this shoulder ache of mine
heracles
surely you must have some other youngsters
at least ten thousand tragic playwrights
all babbling miles further than euripides
dionysus
these are but stunted offshoots and mere blatherings
showcases of swallows banes of the art
which disappear at once if they get a single chorus
just one chance to piss on tragedy
youll not find one creative poet
if you looked to bawl a noble sentiment
heracles
creative how
dionysus
creative like one who utters
some great risky phrase like this
the airy hall of zeus or foot of time
or heart that would not swear by all thats holy
and tongue that swears without consent of mind
heracles
this pleases you
dionysus
im crazy about it
heracles
i think its trash im sure you think so too
dionysus
dont try to run my mind mind your own business
heracles
well i repeat it just seems completely rubbish
dionysus
teach me how to eat
xanthias
no word of me
dionysus
but this is why i have come in this getup
to look like you so you would inform me who they were who took you in in case i needed them the ones you found down there when you went after cerberus
describe to me the harbours bakers shops
brothels  rest stops detours springs and roads
the towns their customs and the inns
where there are fewest bugs
xanthias
no word of me
heracles
why you rash fellow will you too dare to go
dionysus
no more of that but tell me
which of the roads will bring us quickest down to hell
and one thats not too hot nor yet too cold
heracles
well let me see which shall i tell you first which one
theres one starting with a cord and stool
just hang yourself
dionysus
stop thats suffocation
heracles
well heres another short wellbeaten track
the pestle and mortar route
dionysus
you mean hemlock
heracles
exactly
dionysus
too cold and wintry
your shins freeze off immediately
heracles
well shall i tell you of a quick and downhill path
dionysus
oh yes im really no great walker
heracles
just slip on down to ceramicus
dionysus
then what
heracles
climb up onto the top of the tower
dionysus
and do what
heracles
from there observe the torch race starting up
and when the spectators cry there off
you go off too
dionysus
go where
heracles
below
dionysus
but then id lose the two dolmades of my brain
id never go that way
heracles
how will you go
dionysus
the road you went
heracles
its a hell of a haul
right off youll come to an enormous lake
a fathomless abyss
dionysus
how will i get across
heracles
in a little boat just so big an aged mariner will take you over and take two obols for your fare
dionysus
bah how powerful those two obols everywhere
howd they get there
heracles
theseus introduced them
and after this youll see ten thousand snakes
and terrible wild beasts
dionysus
dont frighten me or make me scared
you wont turn me aside
heracles
then a great slough
of everflowing dung and in it lie
any who ever wronged his guest
or screwed a boy and took back the pay
or thrashed his mother or smacked his fathers jaw
or swore a perjured oath
or copied out a speech of morsimus
dionysus
now by the gods besides these there should be
whoever learned kinesias pyrrhic dance
heracles
next a breath of pipes will surround you
youll see a shining light just like up here
then myrtle groves and happy choirs
of men and woman mixed who loudly clap their hands
dionysus
and who are these
heracles
these are the mystic celebrants
xanthias
by god i am the donkey at the mysteries
but i wont put up with this for one more minute
heracles
and these will tell you all you wish to know
for they live closest by the way to plutos door
and now farewell my brother
dionysus
thanks and you too
prosper  but you take the baggage up again
xanthias

dionysus

dionysus
brekekekex koax koax

xanthias
we had best go on
this is the place where wild beasts are
that fellow said
dionysus

he was pretending just to frighten me
he knows that im a warrior and hes jealous
theres nothing quite so boastful as that heracles
now i should only like to meet with some adventure
to win some contest worthy of our trip
xanthias

dionysus

xanthias

dionysus

xanthias
wait now its not a woman but a bitch
dionysus

dionysus

dionysus

dionysus
oh priest preserve me now to be your drinking buddy
xanthias

dionysus

xanthias

xanthias
well never mind come on my noble master
dionysus

xanthias
i swear by zeus
dionysus
again
xanthias
by zeus
dionysus
good grief how i grew pale at the sight of her
xanthias
but this thing of yours got stained reddish brown with  fear
dionysus
alas why do these wretched ills befall me
now which of all the gods shall i accuse of my destruction
the airy hall of zeus or foot of time
sound of a pipe is heard within
dionysus
hey
xanthias
what is it
dionysus
didnt you hear
xanthias
hear what
dionysus
the puff of pipes
xanthias
oh yes and now a whiff
of torches wafted over me most mystically
dionysus
lets crouch down here and listen silently
chorus
o iacchus iacchus o
o iacchus iacchus o
xanthias
this is it master  the band of initiates
are singing here the ones he mentioned to us
theyre chanting diagoras hymn to iacchus
dionysus
i think so too so keeping quiets
the best thing so we can learn for sure
chorus
iacchus here abiding in temples most reverend
iacchus o iacchus
come to dance in this meadow
to your holy mystic bands
shake the leafy crown
around your head brimming
with myrtle
boldly stomp your feet in time
to the wild funloving rite
with full share of the graces the holy dance sacred
to your mystics
xanthias
o reverend mistress daughter of demeter
how sweet that roast pork smells to me
dionysus
keep quiet if you want to get a piece of sausage
chorus
awake for it has come tossing torches in hand
iacchos oh iacchos
the lightbringing star of our nocturnal rite
now the meadow brightly burns
old mens knees start to sway
they shake away their pains
and the long cycles of ancient years
through your holy rite
beaming with your torch
lead forth to the flowering stretch of marsh
the youth that makes your choruses o blessed one
chorus
let him be mute and stand aside from our sacred dances
who has no experience of mystical language or has not cleansed his mind
who never has seen and never has danced in the rites of the noble muses
nor ever has been inducted into the bacchic mysteries of beefeating cratinus
or who takes delight in foolish words when doing this is illtimed
whoever does not eliminate hateful factionalism and is disagreeable to the citizens
but kindles and fans civil strife in his thirst for private advantage
whoever takes bribes when guiding the state through the midst of a storm
or betrays our forts or our ships smuggles contraband from aegina
as thorycion did that wretched collector of taxes
sending pads and sails and pitch to epidauros
or persuades anyone to send supplies to the enemies ships
or defiles hecates shrine while singing dithyrambs
or any politician who bites off the pay of the poets
for being ridiculed in the ancestral rites of dionysus
all these i warn and twice i warn and thrice i warn again
stand aside from our mystical dances but as for you arouse the song
and the nightlong dances that belong to our festival here
chorus
each one boldly marches
to the flowery meadows and glens
stamping in time
jesting joking
and mocking
weve breakfasted enough
chorus
but onward now and nobly extol
the saving goddess
as you chant the melody
she who claims to save our land as the seasons pass
even against thorycions will
chorus
come now sing a different strain of hymn to the harvest queen
the goddess demeter gracing her with sacred airs
chorus
demeter mistress of our holy rites
be present now
and preserve your song and dance
and grant that i may sport and dance the livelong day in safety
chorus
and that i may say much that is funny and much that is serious
and as befits your festival
may i play and joke and win the day and wear the victors crown
chorus
now then
summon the god of the hour with your songs
the partner of this dance of ours
chorus
iacchus honored by all deviser of our festal song
most sweet follow us here
to the goddess and show us how
you travel a long road with ease
iacchus lover of the dance lead me onward
chorus
for as a joke and to save money you split my sandal
and rags and found a way for us to sport and dance scotfree
iacchus lover of the dance lead me onward
chorus
for i just now caught a sidelong glance of a very cute girl
a partner in our dance and through a rip in her robe
i saw a titty peeping out
iacchus lover of the dance lead me onward
dionysus
well im always ready to join in the fun and
i want to dance with her
xanthias
me too
chorus
do you want to join together
and make fun of archedemos
when he was seven he hadnt grown citizen teeth
chorus
but now hes a big politician
amongst the corpses up above
and he takes first prize for villainy
chorus
and cleisthenes i hear
among the tombstones
plucks his rear and rips his cheeks
chorus
beats his breast and bends down low
weeping and wailing
for sebinos the anaphlystian
chorus
and callias they say
the son of horsescrew
fights naval battles with a lion skin covering his crack
dionysus
could you tell us
where pluto lives around here
were strangers just arrived
chorus
you neednt go far
and dont ask me again
but know that youve come to the very door
dionysus
pick them up again my boy
xanthias
this business is nothing
but that old cliché zeus corinth it bugs me
chorus
onward
in the sacred round dance of the goddess in the flowerbearing grove
sporting with all who partake in festival dear to the  goddess
i will go with the women and girls
where they dance all night for the goddess to bring the sacred torch
chorus
lets march to the flowery meadows
blooming with roses
revelling in our fashion
with song and fairest dance
which the blessed
fates array
chorus
we alone enjoy the sun
and the light
who have been initiated
and follow the way of piety
towards strangers
and laymen
dionysus
well how should i knock on the door now how
how do the natives here knock on doors
xanthias
dont waste time take a bite of the door
just like heracles since youve got his form and temper
dionysus
hey porter porter
aeacus
who is it
dionysus
heracles the mighty
aeacus
o impious daring and most shameless wretch
o villain double villain and archvillain
it was you who came before and stole my dog
poor cerberus you gagged and seized him
and then ran off i was guarding him but now weve got you
thus the blackhearted stygian rock
and the crag of acheron dripping with gore
can hold you and the circling hounds of cocytus
and echidna with her hundred heads shall tear
your entrails your lungs will be attacked by
the tartesian eel your kidneys
bleeding with your very entrails
the tithrasian gorgons will rip apart
to them i will direct my hasty foot
xanthias
hey whatd you do
dionysus
i made a mess  call the god
xanthias
ridiculous  quick get up
before some stranger sees you
dionysus
but i feel faint
bring me the sponge and place it near my heart
xanthias
here
dionysus
please apply it
xanthias
where o golden gods
is that where you have your heart
dionysus
it was terrified
and crept into my bowels down below
xanthias
of gods and men you surely are the biggest coward
dionysus
who me
a coward  how so  didnt i ask you for the sponge
another man would not have acted thus
xanthias
what would he do
dionysus
a coward would have lain down flat and smelt  unpleasant
i stood upright and wiped myself besides
xanthias
a manly act by poseidon
dionysus
god i think so
but werent you scared of that rumble of words
and threats
xanthias
god no i didnt even notice
dionysus
well now since youre so brave and heroic
you be me and take my club
and lion skin if youve got fearless guts
and i will be the porter in your place
xanthias
give me that stuff quick i cannot but obey
now look upon the xanthian heracles
and see if i will be a coward and lose heart like you
dionysus
oh no youll be a regular whippingboy of melite
lets go ill take up the pack here
enter female servant of persephone
servant
o dearest heracles youve returned  come right in
when the goddess heard youd arrived right off
she had us bake loaves of bread and boil two or three pots
of ground pea soup and roast a whole ox
bake cakes and cookies do come in
xanthias
fine im much obliged but
servant
by apollo i will not
let you go away since shes also
stewing up some flesh of fowls and cooked
desserts and mixed her sweetest wine
so please come in
xanthias
very nice but
servant
youre kidding
i wont let go of you  theres also a flutegirl for you
inside a beauty and other dancing girls
some two or three
xanthias
whatd you say dancing girls
xanthias
ripe to bursting and freshly plucked
come inside since the cook was just about to take off
the fillets and the tables coming in
xanthias
go on and first tell the dancing girls
who are inside that i myself am coming in
follow slave and bring my baggage
dionysus
you stop youre not really serious
since i dressed you up as heracles for a joke
stop fooling around xanthias
pick the bags back up and bring them along
xanthias
what surely you dont intend to take away from me
what you gave me yourself
dionysus
no maybes im doing it
take off the hide
xanthias
ill sue you
and entrust my case to the gods
dionysus
which gods
to expect that you isnt it vain and foolish
that you a slave and mortal could be alcmenas son
xanthias
well never mind fine take them but maybe soon
youll need me if god so wills
they change again
chorus
this is the mark of a man
whos got wit and brains and
has sailed around the block a few times
to roll himself over
to the prospering side
rather than stand like
a graven image taking a single position
but to change
for the softer
is the mark of a clever man
a true theramenes
dionysus
wouldnt this be a laugh if
xanthias my slave upturned on
milesian blankets
kissing his dancing girl
asked me for a chamber pot
and i looking right at him
grabbed his cucumber
and he being a bully himself
saw me and socked me on the jaw
with his fist knocking out
my front row teeth
enter landladies pandokeutria and plathane
pandokeutria
plathane plathane come here
heres the villain that once came to our inn
and ate up sixteen loaves
plathane
by zeus
thats the very one
xanthias
troubles here for somebody
pandokeutria
and twenty boiled beeves on top of that
at half a buck apiece
xanthias
some one will catch it now
pandokeutria
lots of garlic too
dionysus
surely you jest good woman
you dont know what youre saying
pandokeutria
what did you think that
because youre wearing those booties i wouldnt recognise  you
plathane
what else  ive not yet mentioned the pickled fish
oh no  and the new cheese the wretch
that he devoured baskets and all
pandokeutria
then when i figured out the price
he looked straight in my face and bellowed fierce
xanthias
thats his doing all right its his manner everywhere
pandokeutria
then he drew his sword and seemed insane
plathane
he did poor woman
pandokeutria
we both were terrified
we ran up to the loft at once
but he took off after grabbing our rugs
xanthias
thats his way as well
plathane
but we should take some  action
pandokeutria
go on and call my patron cleon
plathane
and if you meet hyperbolus summon him for me
so we can rub this guy out
pandokeutria
detested throat
how id love to take a rock and smash your molars out
with which you ate up all my wares
plathane
and i could throw you in the deepest pit
pandokeutria
and i should like to take a scythe and slice the throat that swallowed up my tripe
plathane
but im going after cleon wholl deliver a summons
and reel it out of him today
dionysus
now may i die but xanthias i do love you
xanthias
i know what youre thinking i know but stop not another word  i wont be heracles again
dionysus
dont say that xanthias
xanthias
how could i ever be
alcmenes son since im a slave and mortal too
dionysus
i know youre angry i know and youve every right to be
even if you beat me id never contradict you
but if i ever take anything from you in time to come
may i be cut off root and branch may i myself my wife my children perish and cockeyed archedemus all together
xanthias
i accept the oath and on these terms ill take them
chorus
now again its your job since
youve taken the robe which
you had at the start again
to rejuvenate yourself
and cast an awful glance
mindful of the god
to whom you liken yourself
but if youre caught babbling
or emit some cowardly sound
youll have to pick up
the baggage again
xanthias
not bad advice my friends
and i just happened to think
this myself
since if theres anything good
hell try to take this back from me
i know full well
but nonetheless ill show
myself manly of heart
and spicy of look
i think ill need to since i hear
just now a knock on the door
enter aeacus
aeacus
quick bind this dogthief
so hell pay the penalty  hurry up
dionysus
troubles here for somebody
xanthias
go to blazes  dont come near me
aeacus
oho you put up a fight ditylas skeblias and pardocas come here and fight this guy
dionysus
isnt it awful that this fellow puts up a fight
swiping other peoples goods besides
aeacus
just monstrous
dionysus
downright mean and awful
xanthias
i swear by god
im willing to die if ever i came here before
or stole anything of yours thats worth a hair
and ill do the noble thing by you
here take this slave of mine and torture him
and if you find that ive done wrong take me out and kill  me
aeacus
how may i torture him
xanthias
every way tie him to a ladder
hang him flog him with spikes flay him
twist him pour vinegar up his nose
pile up loads of bricks  everything else except
dont beat him with a leek or tender onion
aeacus
a fair offer and if i should cripple your
boy in the beating  youll get compensation
xanthias
no not for me  just take him away and torture him
aeacus
no i will do it here so hell confess before your eyes
quick you put down your pack and make sure
you tell no lies
dionysus
i forbid anyone
from torturing me an immortal  or else
youll have yourself to blame
aeacus
whatd you say
dionysus
i say that i am dionysus son of zeus
and this man is my slave
aeacus
you hear that
xanthias
i do
so much more reason he should be whipped
because if he is a god he wont feel it
dionysus
well then since you too claim to be a god
why not get hit as many blows as me
xanthias
a fair offer whichever of us two
you first see cry or noticing at all
being beaten be sure hes not the god
aeacus
its for certain you are an honest fellow
you go for justice now strip you both
xanthias
how will you fairly judge
aeacus
easily
blow for blow each one
xanthias
good idea
aeacus
there
xanthias
watch if you see me flinch
aeacus
i already hit you
xanthias
you did not
aeacus
i guess i didnt
so now ill go and whack this guy
dionysus
well when
aeacus
why i hit you
dionysus
then why didnt i even sneeze
aeacus
i dont know  ill try this one again
xanthias
well hurry up wahoo
aeacus
whats this wahoo
that didnt hurt did it
xanthias
o no i just thought
of the herculean feast at diomeia
aeacus
a holy man and now ive got to go back here
dionysus
o whoa
aeacus
what is it
dionysus
i see some horsemen
aeacus
so why are you crying
dionysus
because i smell onions
aeacus
then you dont notice anything
dionysus
dont mind at all
aeacus
well in that case i must go back to this one
xanthias
yow
aeacus
what is it
xanthias
pull out this thorn
aeacus
whats going on  got to go back here
dionysus
apollo who hast delos and pytho
xanthias
he got hurt didnt you hear
dionysus
not me its just that
i was recalling a verse of hipponax
xanthias
youre getting nowhere  hit him in the side
aeacus
youre right  now stick out that belly
dionysus
poseidon
xanthias
someone got hurt
dionysus
who rules the aegean headlands and in the gray seas depths
aeacus
i swear by demeter that i cant discover
which of you is the god but come on in
my master himself will soon find out
and persephone since they are gods themselves
dionysus
now youre making sense  i only wish that you had
done that before i took those whacks
chorus
muse of the sacred dances advance and come to enjoy my  song
to see the great throng of people where wits
sit by the thousand
more honorable than cleophon on whose babbling lips
roars terribly
a thracian swallow
sitting on an alien leaf
she rumbles her sorrowful nightingales song since he will  perish
even in case of a tie
chorus
it is right and just for our sacred chorus  to advise and teach whats good for the city  so first it seems best to us
to equalize the citizens and take away their fears
and if anyone went astray tripped by the wrestling moves  of phrynichus
i say it should be possible for those who slipped up then
to plead their cause and erase their previous mistakes
because its disgraceful that those who fought just once at  sea
should suddenly be plataeans and masters instead of  slaves
no even this i couldnt say wasnt well and good
in fact i praise it  its the only sensible thing you did
but its also fair for people whove fought so much at sea
with you as did their fathers people who are related to  your race
that you let pass their one misfortune as they request
but letting up on your anger you who are wisest in nature
lets gladly make everyone our kinsman
and fullfledged citizens too whos ever fought for us at  sea
but if we swell up with pride at this and give the city airs
especially since were in the grasp of the waves
in time to come again well get a reputation for stupidity
chorus
if im a fair judge of the life and habits of a man who will yet come to grief
not long will this annoying ape
cleigenes the tiny
the nastiest bathman of all who rule the ashmixed
polluted soda lye
and the cimolian earth
not long will he be around  but knowing this
hes no pacifist lest he ever be stripped while
wandering drunk without his staff
chorus
many times it seems to us the city has done
the same thing with the best and the brightest of its  citizens
as with the old coinage and the new gold currency
for these not counterfeit at all
but the finest it seems of all coins
and the only ones of the proper stamp of resounding metal
amongst greeks and foreigners everywhere
we never use but the inferior bronze ones instead
minted just yesterday or the day before with the basest  stamp
so too the citizens whom we know to be noble and virtuous
and righteous and true men of quality
and trained in the palaestra and dancing and music
these we despise but the brazen foreigners and redheads
worthless sons of worthless fathers these we use for  everything
these latest parvenus whom the city before this
wouldnt have lightly used even for random scapegoats
but now you dimwits change your ways
and employ the good ones again  and if you succeed
its praiseworthy  but if you stumble at least youll hang from a respectable tree
so wise men will think if anything happens to you
enter xanthias and aeacus
aeacus
by zeus our saviour a real gentleman
is your master
xanthias
of course hes a real gentleman
he only knows how to drink and screw
aeacus
but not to beat you then and there when it was proved
that youre the slave but claimed to be the master
xanthias
hed sure regret it
aeacus
thats a right slavish thing
you did just now the kind of thing i like to do myself
xanthias
beg pardon you like that
aeacus
even more im practically in ecstasy
when i curse my master behind his back
xanthias
what about your grumbling when after getting
a good beating you run outside
aeacus
i love that too
xanthias
and what of meddling
aeacus
its like nothing else i know by god
xanthias
zeus of family ties  and eavesdropping on the masters
when they gossip
aeacus
it drives me even crazier
xanthias
what about blabbing it all to outsiders
aeacus
who me
god when i do that i stain my pants
xanthias
phoebus apollo put your right hand there
let me kiss you you kiss me too and tell me
by zeus who is our fellow whipping boy
whats all this noise inside and shouting
and abuse
aeacus
thats euripides and aeschylus
xanthias
huh
aeacus
big big troubles stirring
among the dead and nasty civil war
xanthias
for what
aeacus
there is a custom established here
in all the great and noble arts
that the best man in his own field of talent
gets his meals in the town hall
and the seat next to pluto
xanthias
i get it
aeacus
until someone wiser in the art arrives
than he and then must he give way
xanthias
so why has this disturbed aeschylus
aeacus
he held the chair of tragedy
as the mightiest in that art
xanthias
and who does now
aeacus
why when euripides came down he started showing off
to the muggers and the pickpockets
parricides and burglars
and thats the majority in hades and listening to
his speeches pro and con and twists and turns
they went crazy and hailed him the wisest
then he all excited claimed the throne
where aeschylus was sitting
xanthias
and wasnt he bombarded
aeacus
lord no the plebs cried out to have a trial
to see which was the better dramatist
xanthias
the crowd of rascals
aeacus
oh yes as high as heaven
xanthias
didnt aeschylus have others to take his side
aeacus
the bests a small group just like here
xanthias
and what is pluto planning to do
aeacus
to hold the contest right away and a trial
and test of their skill
xanthias
and how is it then
that sophocles didnt claim the throne as well
aeacus
not him by zeus but he kissed aeschylus
when he arrived and shook his hand
and yielded the chair to him
now he intends so says cleidemides
to sit out in reserve and if aeschylus wins
hell stay put if not he said hed fight
against euripides for the sake of his art
xanthias
so this thing will really happen
aeacus
yes just a little later
and here therell be an awful commotion
for poetry will be measured out on scales
xanthias
what theyre going to weigh tragedy by the ounce
aeacus
and theyll bring out rulers and verbal yardsticks
and flexible frames
xanthias
then theyll be making bricks
aeacus
and bevels and wedges  because euripides
says hell test the plays word by word
xanthias
i guess aeschylus is taking it pretty hard
aeacus
well he lowered his head and cast a bullish glance
xanthias
and whos to be the judge
aeacus
that was difficult
youll find a shortage of sophisticated men
aeschylus didnt get along with the athenians
xanthias
maybe he thought most of them were crooks
aeacus
and he considered the rest trash for judging
the essence of poets so to your master
they turned since he has experience in the art
but lets go in for when masters
are in a hurry it means trouble for us
chorus
surely the dreadful thunderer will feel wrath within him
as he looks at the rival whetting his babbling tusk
then his eyes will spin with awful madness
chorus
there will be the helmetblazing strife of horsecrested phrases
axlesplinterings as the chiselworking fellow defends himself
against the horsegalloping utterances of the mindbuilding man
chorus
bristling the shaggynecked mane of his naturalhair crest
knitting his terrible brow bellowing he will launch
boltfastened utterances  ripping them apart board by board
with gigantic blast of breath
chorus
then the mouthworker tester of phrases smooth
tongue unfurling stirring the reins of envy
dissecting the utterances will quibble away
the great labor of his lungs
euripides
i will never yield the chair no more advice
for i claim to be this mans superior in the art
dionysus
why are you silent aeschylus you hear what he says
euripides
first hell put on solemn airs just as so often
he used to  pull those hoaxes in his tragedies
dionysus
my good sir dont talk so high and mighty
euripides
i know him well and have long examined him
creator of crude characters stubbornmouthed
hes got an unbridled uncontrolled ungated mouth
uncircumlocuitous bragbundlevoiced
aeschylus
is that right you child of the garden goddess
you call me that you gossipgathering
beggarmaking son of a ragstitcher
youll be sorry for saying that
dionysus
cease aeschylus
dont heat up your innards with wrath so angrily
aeschylus
oh no not before i thoroughly expose this
cripplecreator for the braggart that he is
dionysus
a sheep a black sheep boys bring one out
for a typhoon is fixing to let loose
aeschylus
you collector of cretan arias
bringing unholy wedlocks to our art
dionysus
hold on there muchdistinguished aeschylus
and you you rogue euripides  get out of the way
of this hailstorm if you are wise
lest with some heady phrase he crack your skull
in anger and spill out your telephus
and you dont get angry aeschylus but gently
test and be tested its just not proper
for poets to abuse each other like fishwives
but you roar like an oak on fire
euripides
i am prepared and do not delay
to bite be bitten first if thats his preference
as to the lines and lyrics the sinews of a tragedy
i swear by zeus by peleus and by aeolus
by meieager too and even more by telephus
dionysus
and what do you plan to do speak aeschylus
aeschylus
i didnt want to join in battle here
our combat will not be on equal terms
dionysus
how so
aeschylus
my poetry did not die with me
as his has died with him so hell have it to recite
but nonetheless since you prefer it must be done
dionysus
come now someone bring incense and fire
so i can pray before the show of wits
to judge this contest most aesthetically
and you sing a song to the muses
chorus
ye nine virgin daughters of zeus blessed
muses who look down upon the subtlespeaking clever wits
of phraseforging men when to strife
they come debating with fiercely studied crooked wrestling holds
come to observe the power
of most awesome mouths to provide
sayings and sawdust of words
for now the great contest of skill is getting down to business
dionysus
now both say a prayer before speaking your verses
aeschylus
demeter nourisher of my mind
grant that i be worthy of thy mysteries
dionysus
now you too take and offer incense
euripides
fine
but i have other gods i pray to
dionysus
your own private ones newly minted
euripides
yes indeed
dionysus
well pray away to these private gods
euripides
o air my sustenance and pivot of my tongue
and intelligence and olfactory nostrils
may i stoutly refute whatever words i seize
chorus
truly do we desire
to hear from these clever men what
warpath of words you walk on
for their tongue is savage
and the temper of both is not without boldness
nor their wits lethargic
it seems likely to expect
that the one will utter something urbane
and finely honed
while the other pulling up by the root
his arguments to attack with
will scatter the many wallows of words
dionysus
now you must talk as fast as you can and see that you both speak
elegantly and no similes or the things someone else might say
euripides
well of myself and what sort of poet i am
i will tell at the end but first ill prove that this man
was an impostor and a cheat and how he took the spectators and used to fool the dupes reared with  phrynichos
first hed wrap up and sit down someone or other
an achilles or  niobe not showing the face
a facade of tragedy not mumbling so much as this
dionysus
thats right they didnt
euripides
and then the chorus boomed
four strings of lyric in a row nonstop but they kept quiet
dionysus
and l enjoyed their silence that pleased me
no less than the babblers now
euripides
because you were stupid
no doubt about it
dionysus
i think so too why did the soandso do this
euripides
from fraudulence so the spectator would sit there  waiting
for when niobe would say something  and the play would  go on
dionysus
oh what a villain  how i was fooled by him
why do you stretch and act uncomfortable
euripides
because im convicting him
and then after he pulled this cheap trick and the play
was already half over hed speak a dozen bullish words
with eyebrows crests some awful witchfaced things
unknown to the audience
aeschylus
woe is me alas
dionysus
quiet
euripides
yet not a thing he said was clear
dionysus
dont saw your teeth
euripides
but scamanders or trenches or shieldadorning
bronzebeaten griffoneagles and horsecliffed phrases
which it was not easy to construe
dionysus
ye gods  as for me
one night did i pass sleepless all the while
wondering what sort of bird the yellow hipporooster was
aeschylus
you blockhead its a symbol engraved on ships
dionysus
i thought it was eryxis philoxenus son
euripides
then did you have to create a rooster in tragedy
aeschylus
you goddetested wretch  what sort of things did
you used to compose
euripides
not hipporoosters by god nor goatstags like you
which they depict on persian tapestries
but when i first received the art from you
she was swollen from bombast and ponderous diction
at once i slimmed her down and took off weight
with versicles and strolls and laxative roots
giving a dose of drivel strained from books
then i nursed it back with monodies
dionysus
mixing in cephisophon
euripides
then i didnt say whatever nonsense occurred to me nor  knead in what i fell upon
but the character who came out first would straightway
tell the background of the play
dionysus
better than your own by zeus
euripides
then from the opening words i permitted nothing idle my woman spoke as did the slave as well
or master maiden or old woman
aeschylus
then really
shouldnt you be put to death for daring this
euripides
no by apollo
for this was a democratic thing i did
dionysus
let it go sir
its not best for you to digress on that point
euripides
then i taught these folks to speak up
aeschylus
ill say
i wish before that lesson you had split down the middle
euripides
and the introduction of subtle rules and squaredoff  words
to think to see to understand to love to twist to connive
to suspect the worst to overthink all things
aeschylus
ill say
euripides
introducing domestic matters which were used to and understand
on which i could be tested for these folks are knowledgeable
and could have criticized my art  but i didnt toss off boasts
drawing them away from common sense and i didnt scare them
creating cycnuses and memnons of the bellcheeked steeds
youll recognize the disciples of both this fellow and myself
his are phormisios and manic meganeitos
sons of longbeard lancers pinetree flesh rippers
but mine are cleitophon and theramenes the dandy
dionysus
theramenes a clever fellow  an allround wonder
if he runs into trouble and happens to be close by
hes thrown clear of the trouble no chian but a kian
euripides
well to ponder such things i
instructed these folks here
putting logic in my art
and scrutiny so now they notice
everything and know through and through
most especially how to run
the household better than before
and they inquire hows this doing
wheres this  who took that
dionysus
yes by gods  in fact now
every single athenian goes inside
and yells to his servants
and asks wheres my pot
whos eaten off the head
of my sardine my bowl
of yesteryear has it perished
where is yesterdays garlic
who nibbled at the olive
before now the biggest dummies
gaping mammas boys
would just sit like blockheads
chorus
seest thou this shining achilles
come now what will you say to that  just be sure
that your temper doesnt get hold of you
and carry you out of bounds
for he has made terrible accusations
but come o noble one
do not contradict him in anger
but reef in your sails
use only the tips
then little by little youll bring her to
and watch out for when
you may catch a calmed and gentle breeze
dionysus
oh you who first of the greeks built solemn phrases
and decorated tragic nonsense take heart and let loose your spout
aeschylus
i am indignant at this encounter and it gripes my guts
if i have to argue against this fellow but so that he cant say i was helpless
answer me why should one admire a poet
euripides
for cleverness and giving good advice since we improve
the people in the cities
aeschylus
so if you havent done this
but turned them from fine and decent types into villains
what will you say you deserve to suffer
dionysus
death dont ask him
aeschylus
consider now what kind of men he first received from  me
if they were generous and six feet tall no runaway citizens
no loafers rascals like now nor miscreants
but men who breathed spears and lances whitecrested  helmets
and headgear and greaves and sevenfold oxhide tempers
dionysus
this is really getting bad hell crush me with his  helmetmaking
euripides
and what did you do to teach men to be so noble
dionysus
speak aeschylus dont be a stubborn highfalutin sorehead
aeschylus
i composed a drama filled with mars
dionysus
which one
aeschylus
the seven against thebes
everyone who saw it fell in love with being fierce
dionysus
that was a bad thing you did since you made the thebans
more courageous in war  for that at least get whacked
aeschylus
you could have trained for this as well but you  werent so inclined
then producing the persians after that i taught them to  yearn
to beat the enemy this finest feat did i honor
dionysus
well i rejoiced when you lamented for the death of darius
and the chorus straightway clapped their hands like this and said eeow
aeschylus
this is the stuff poets should work on  just look right from the start
how useful the noble race of poets has been
for orpheus taught us rites and to refrain from killing
and musaeus taught the cures of illness and oracles and  hesiod
the working of the land harvest seasons plowing  divine homer
where did he get honor and glory if not from teaching useful things
battle lines courageous deeds mens armory
dionysus
but i bet he didnt
teach pantacles that clumsy oaf  the other day when he was parading
he fastened his helmet on first and then was going to tie on the crest
aeschylus
and many other brave men too of which the hero lamachos was one
from homer my brain composed many great feats of valor
of patrocluses lionhearted teucrians so i could rouse the citizenry
to strive to equal them when it hears the call to arms
but by god i never created whores like phaedra and sthenoboea
no ones ever known me to write about any woman in love
euripides
no sir youve got nothing to do with aphrodite
aeschylus
and may she stay away
but she settled down on you and yours in force
and destroyed your very self
dionysus
by god that she did
what you used to do to other menss wives you got hit with  yourself
euripides
and how have my stheneboeas harmed the state you wretch
aeschylus
since you persuaded noble ladies wives of noble men
to drink hemlock out of shame because of people like that bellerophon of yours
euripides
so did i make up some nonexistent story about phaedra
aeschylus
no it existed  but a poet should conceal wickedness not bring it forward and teach it for little boys
have a teacher who advises them and grownups have  poets
we have a serious obligation to speak of honorable things
euripides
so if you speak to us of lycabettuses
and the heights of parnassuses this is teaching honorable  things
when a poet ought to speak in human terms
aeschylus
you fiend  it is the compelling power
of great thoughts and ideas to engender phrases of equal  size
and anyway it is proper that demigods speak in grander terms
for they also wear much finer clothes
what i so nobly exhibited you defiled
euripides
what did i do
aeschylus
first you dressed the kingly types in rags so
theyd look pitiful to the audience
euripides
and what harm did i do by that
aeschylus
because of that no wealthy man was willing to fund the navy
but wrapped in rags he weeps and claims hes poor
dionysus
by demeter yes but wearing a tunic of pure wool underneath
and if he fooled em with that story hed pop up in the fish market
aeschylus
then again you taught them to practice drivel and gossip
which emptied the gymnasia and ruined the butts
of our prattling youths and persuaded the paralian crews
to argue with their officers  but when i was alive
they knew nothing but to call for grits and sing yoho
dionysus
yessir and fart in the face of their rowing mate
dump on their mess partner go ashore and rob someone
but now he argues and doesnt row and sails to and fro
aeschylus
of what crimes is he not guilty
didnt he show pimps
women giving birth in temples
sleeping with their brothers
claiming that life is not life
and then our state
is filled with these bureaucrats
and oafish democratic apes
always cheating the people
and theres no one able to carry the torch
any more because of lack of training
dionysus
no sir not any more  so that i laughed
myself dry at the panathenaic games when
some slow guy ran hunched over
pale drunk left behind
and doing miserably  and then the folks of the ceramicus
at the gates hit his
stomach ribs sides butt
and he getting whacked with their hands
broke wind
blew out the torch and ran away
chorus
great the event abundant the strife grand the war that advances
so its hard work to choose
when one strains violently
while the other can twist around and bear down sharply
but dont just sit where you are
for the attacks of wit are many and varied
so for what you have to quarrel over
speak out lay on beat up
the old stuff and the new
and dare to say something subtle and smart
chorus
but if youre both afraid that our spectators lack a certain amount of knowledge so as
not to appreciate the fine points of what you say
dont worry about that since that is no longer the case
for they are seasoned veterans
and each one has a book and understands the clever stuff
their minds are superior anyway
but now theyre really sharpened
so fear not but
scrutinize every topic for the audiences sake at least since theyre so sophisticated
euripides
all right then ill turn to your prologues themselves
so that first of all i can test the first section
of this clever poets tragedy
for he was unclear in the explanation of events
dionysus
which one of his will you test
euripides
quite a lot
first recite to me the start of the oresteia
dionysus
now silence every one  speak aeschylus
aeschylus
subterranean hermes guardian of my fathers  realms
become my savior and my ally in answer to my prayer
for i am come and do return to this my land
dionysus
do you have something to criticize in this
euripides
more than a dozen
dionysus
but the whole thing wasnt more than three lines
euripides
and each one has twenty mistakes
dionysus
i warn you to keep quiet aeschylus if not
on top of these three verses youll wind up owing more
aeschylus
me be quiet for him
dionysus
if you take my advice
euripides
right off he made mistakes as high as heaven
aeschylus
you see that youre ranting
euripides
doesnt bother me in the least
aeschylus
what mistakes do you claim i make
euripides
repeat it from the start one more time
aeschylus
subterranean hermes guardian of my fathers realms
euripides
doesnt orestes say this at the grave
of his dead father
aeschylus
i grant that much
euripides
well seeing that his father died a death
of violence slain by a womans hand
in a secret plot how can he say that hermes guarded  anything
dionysus
not that one but the luckbringer
hermes he called subterranean and he made it clear by saying
that he has this function from his father
euripides
you made an even bigger mistake than i imagined
for if he has this underground junction from his father
dionysus
then hed be a grave robber on his fathers side
aeschylus
dionysus the wine you drink doesnt smell too good
dionysus
recite another for him  and you watch out for damage
aeschylus
become my savior and my ally in answer to my  prayer
for i am come and do return to this my land
euripides
sage aeschylus has said the same thing twice
dionysus
how twice
euripides
look at his words and ill tell you
i am come to this my land he says and do return
to come is the same thing as to return
dionysus
right just as if a man said to his neighbour
lend me a dish and if you please a saucer
aeschylus
thats not so at all you blabbermouth
its not the same but uses the best choice of words
euripides
how so  show me what youre talking about
aeschylus
to come to a land is for someone who owns a  fatherland
an exile both arrives and does return
dionysus
well done by apollo   what do you say euripides
euripides
i deny orestes returned home
for he came secretly without permission of the authorities
dionysus
well done by hermes but i dont know what you mean
euripides
continue now with another
dionysus
yes do go on
aeschylus hurry up  and you look out for something bad
aeschylus
at this tombmound do i my sire entreat
to hear and listen
euripides
this is another thing he repeats
to hear and listen are clearly the same thing
dionysus
because he was speaking to the dead you idiot
whom we dont even reach with the triple lament
aeschylus
well how did you make prologues
euripides
ill tell you
and if i ever i say the same word twice or if you see padding
in there irrelevant to the plot spit on me
dionysus
speak come on  for i cannot but hear
the correctness of your prologues diction
euripides
at first was oedipus a prosperous man
aeschylus
good lord not at all he was illstarred by nature
before his birth apollo said that he
would kill his father even before he was begotten
how could he at first have been a lucky man
euripides
then he became in turn the wretchedest of mortals
aeschylus
no not at all he never ceased to be
hows that  since as soon as he was born
they exposed him in a broken pot at wintertime
so he wouldnt grow up to be his fathers murderer
then he dragged himself to polybus on swollen feet
after that he married an old woman though young himself
and on top of that she was his own mother
then he blinded himself
dionysus
so he was happy then
at least if he had campaigned with erasinides
euripides
youre fooling i craft my prologues beautifully
aeschylus
oh really  well by zeus not word by word will i  grate
each phrase of yours but with the gods help
ill demolish your prologues with a little oil flask
euripides
my prologues with an oil flask
aeschylus
a single one
for you compose in such a way that everything fits in
a little fleece a little oil flask and little bag
in your iambics  ill prove it here and now
euripides
look here  youll prove it
aeschylus
i say so
dionysus
well then youve got to speak
euripides
aegyptus so the widespread rumor runs
with fifty children in a longoared boat
landing near argos
aeschylus
lost his little oil flask
dionysus
what was this oil flask  youll be sorry
recite for him another prologue so i can see once more
euripides
dionysus who with thyrsus wands and fawnskins
bedecked amidst the pines on mt parnassus
bounds dancing
aeschylus
lost his little oil flask
dionysus
alas again we have been stricken by that flask
euripides
it wont be a problem  for to this
prologue he wont be able to attach that flask
no man exists whos altogether blest
either nobly sired he has no livelihood
or else baseborn he
aeschylus
lost his little oil flask
dionysus
euripides
euripides
what is it
dionysus
i think you should pull in your sails
that oil flask is going to blow up quite a storm
euripides
by demeter i wouldnt think of it
for this one here will knock it away from him
dionysus
go on and recite another then but keep away from the  flask
euripides
abandoning the town of sidon cadmus
agenors son
aeschylus
lost his little oil flask
dionysus
my fine fellow buy the flask
so he cant smash our prologues
euripides
what
i should buy it from him
dionysus
if you take my advice
euripides
oh no for i have many prologues to recite
where he cant tack on a flask
to pisa pelops son of tantalus
borne on swift coursers
aeschylus
lost his little oil flask
dionysus
you see he stuck on the flask again
but dear sir pay him now by all means
youll get it for an obol nice and neat
euripides
not yet by zeus i still have plenty left
from the land once oeneus
aeschylus
lost his little oil flask
euripides
let me say the whole line first
from the land  once oeneus reaped a plenteous crop
the first fruits offering
aeschylus
lost his little oil flask
dionysus
in the midst of sacrificing  who swiped it
euripides
leave it be sir just let him speak to this
zeus as once was spoke in very truth
dionysus
youll get killed for hell say lost his little oil flask this oil flask it grows on your prologues
like warts on the eyes
for gods sake turn to his lyrics
euripides
all right i have ways to show how bad
a songwriter he is and always makes them just the same
chorus
whatever will happen now
i can only imagine
what complaints he will make
against the man who wrote by far the most
and finest songs up to now
i wonder how
hell criticize this man
the dionysiac lord
and i fear for him
euripides
quite marvelous songs as this will soon make clear
for ill condense all his songs into one point
dionysus
well then ill grab some pebbles and keep score
euripides
o phthian achilles if you hear the manslaughtering
crash ah why do you not come to our aid
to hermes we the ancestral race  pay homage by the lake
crash ah why do you not come to our aid
dionysus
thats two crashes for you aeschylus
euripides
most glorious of the achaeans farruling son of atreus learn of me
crash ah why do you not come to our aid
dionysus
this is your third crash aeschylus
euripides
be still  the beenuns draw near to open the temple of artemis
crash ah why do you not come to our aid
i am charged with uttering the heroes fateful command of the journey
crash ah why do you not come to our aid
dionysus
king zeus what a load of crashes
i for one want to go to the bathhouse
for my kidneys are swollen with all this crashing
euripides
dont before you hear another set of odes
assembled from his melodies for the lyre
dionysus
go on continue but leave out the crash
euripides
how the twinthroned power of the achaeans of grecian youth
tophlattothrattoplilattothrat
sends the sphinx unlucky presiding dog
tophlattothrattophlattothrat
the swooping bird with spear and avenging hand
tophlattothrattophlattothrat
granting to the headlong skyflying dogs to meet
tophlattothrattophlattothrat
the united force against ajax
tophlattothrattophlattothrat
dionysus
what is this phlattothrat  is it from marathon or
where did you assemble these songs of a ropetwister
aeschylus
well to a fine place from a fine place did i
bring them lest i be seen garnering from the same meadow as phrynichos
but this guy gets them from everywhere from little whores
meletus drinking songs carian flute solos
dirges dances  this will all be made clear immediately
someone bring in a lyre  and yet what need
of a lyre for this guy  wheres the girl who clacks the castanets  hither muse of euripides
for whom these songs are appropriate to sing
dionysus
this muse never did the lesbian thing oh no
aeschylus
halcyon kingfishers who by the seas everflowing
waves do chatter
moistening  the surface of your wings with damp
drops bedewing
and ye spiders who in the corners under the roof
wiyiyiyiyiyind with your fingers
loomstretched threads
the cares of the shuttle bard
where the fluteloving dolphin was leaping
by the bluepeaked prows
oracles and stades
wineblooming joy of the vine
painkilling spiral of grapes
cast your arms about me child
you see this foot
dionysus
i see it
aeschylus
well do you see this one
dionysus
i see it
aeschylus
well you write this sort of thing
and dare to criticize my lyrics
you composer in the twelve tone style of cyrene
so much for his songs  i still want
to scrutinize the manner of his melodies
oh darkshining nights
gloom what woeful dream
do you send to me from unseen hades
vestibules possessing a soulless
soul child
of black night hairraising horrible
sight blackcorpseshrouded murder murder
envisioning with long fingernails
now servants light my lamp
draw moisture in pitchers from the rivers and heat water
that i might wash away the divine dream
o marine spirit
so thats it  o housemates
behold these portents
snatching my rooster
glyce has fled
mountainborn nymphs
o mania help
but i the wretched one
happened to be performing my
tasks the spindle full of thread
wiyiyinding in my hands
making a skein so that
at dawn to the market
i could bring it to sell
but it has flown away flown away into the air
on the nimblest tips of its wings
but to me it left woes woes
and tears tears from my eyes
i shed shed oh wretched me
now o cretans sons of ida
take your bows and come to the rescue
bestir your limbs and circle the house
and also may child dictynna artemis the fair
bring her doggies and come to my house by all means
and you daughter of zeus upholding twin
torches most piercing in your hands
hecate shine me towards glyces
so i can go in and catch her in the act
dionysus
stop with the songs already
aeschylus
ive had enough too
for now i want to bring him to the scale
which alone will put our poetry to the test
for it will prove the weight of our phrases
dionysus
then come here if i really have to do this
to deal with poets just like selling cheese
chorus
painstaking are the men of wit
for once again heres another marvel
brand new full of the unusual
who else could have thought it up
oh my id never not if anybody
i ran into told me
have believed it but i would have thought
he was talking nonsense
dionysus
come on and stand beside the balance pans
aeschylus and euripides
here we are
dionysus
now each of you grab hold and speak a verse
and dont let go till i yell cuckoo
euripides and aeschylus
we holding on
dionysus
now recite the line into the scales
euripides
would that the argive bark had never winged
aeschylus
stream of spercheius haunts of grazing kine
dionysus
cuckoo its released and much further down
goes this mans side
euripides
whatever is the reason
dionysus
because he introduced a stream like fabric salesmen
he made his verse wet just like the wool
but you put in a winged word
euripides
well let him say something else and match me
dionysus
grab hold again
aeschylus and euripides
all set
dionysus
speak
euripides
persuasion has no other shrine save speech
aeschylus
death is the only god that loves not bribes
dionysus
let go let go this ones is tilting once again
for he inserted death weightiest of ills
euripides
and i persuasion a saying beautifully expressed
dionysus
persuasion is but light and makes no sense
but this time find some other ponderous line
that will pull down on your side something high and mighty
euripides
tell me where oh where do i have something like that
dionysus
ill tell you
dionysus
achilles threw snake eyes and a four
please speak since this is your last weighin
euripides
heavy with iron was the club his right hand seized
aeschylus
chariot on chariot corpse on corpse
dionysus
he fooled you again this time
euripides
in what way
dionysus
two chariots and two corpses he put in
which not even a hundred egyptians could ever lift
aeschylus
no more word by word for me into the scales
himself his kids the wife cephisophon
let him step in and sit down taking all his books
ill only speak two verses of mine
dionysus
they are my friends and i wont judge them
for i will not be on hostile terms with either one
one i consider clever the other i enjoy
pluto
then will you accomplish nothing of what you came for
dionysus
but if i choose the other one
pluto
take whichever one you choose
and go so that you wont have come in vain
dionysus
bless you  come listen to this
i came down here for a poet for what purpose
so that the city might be saved to stage its choruses
so whichever of you will give the state some useful
advice thats the one i think ill take
now first concerning alcibiades what opinion
does each of you have  for the city is in heavy labor
euripides
what opinion does she have concerning him
dionysus
what opinion
she longs for him but hates him and yet she wants him back
but tell me what you two think about him
euripides
i hate that citizen who to help his fatherland
seems slow but swift to do great harm
of profit to himself but useless to the state
dionysus
well said by poseidon whats your opinion
aeschylus
you should not rear a lion cub in the city
best not to rear a lion in the city
but if one is brought up accommodate its ways
dionysus
by zeus the savior i cant decide
for one has spoken cleverly and the other one clearly
now each of you once more tell me your opinion
about the state what plan you have to save her
euripides
if you feathered cleocritus with cinesias
the breezes would lift them over the oceans plane
dionysus
that would be funny but what does it mean
euripides
if there were a sea battle and then they had bottles of vinegar
they could squirt them in the enemies eyes
i do know and wish to tell
dionysus
speak
euripides
when we what faithless is do faithful hold
and what is faithful faithless
dionysus
hows that  i dont understand
speak with less erudition and more clarity
euripides
if we distrusted those citizens in whom
we now place confidence and employed
those we dont use now we would be saved
if we now are suffering under the present circumstances
why wouldnt we be saved by doing the opposite
dionysus
well done palamedes you cleverest creature
did you discover this yourself or did cephisophon
euripides
just me but cephison added the vinegar bottles
and what about you  what do you say
aeschylus
as to the state now tell me
first what people does she employ  the good ones perhaps
dionysus
whered you get that idea
she hates them worst of all
aeschylus
but loves the scoundrels
dionysus
no she really doesnt  she uses them perforce
aeschylus
how could anyone save such a city
that likes neither finespun wool nor scratchy goatskin
dionysus
find something by zeus if youre going to rise up again
aeschylus
there i would speak but here i do not wish
dionysus
dont say that but send up some good advice from here
aeschylus
when they consider the land of the enemy
to be their own and their own the enemys
their ships a revenue and their revenue a loss
dionysus
right except the juries guzzle it by themselves
pluto
please decide
dionysus
this will be my decision for them
ill choose the one my soul desires
euripides
remember now the gods by whom you swore
to take me home and choose your friends
dionysus
my tongue did swear but aeschylus i choose
euripides
what have you done filthiest of men
dionysus
who me
i decided that aeschylus wins  why not
euripides
you did this foulest deed and look me in the face
dionysus
whats foul if the audience thinks not so
euripides
you brute will you neglect me now im dead
dionysus
who knows if to live is not to die
to breathe to dine and sleep a rug
pluto
step inside then dionysus
dionysus
what for
pluto
so i may feast you two before you sail off
dionysus
good idea
by god im not averse to that
chorus
blessed is the man having
perfected intelligence
one can learn this in many ways
for this man of proven good sense
will go back home again
for the good of his citizens
for the good of his own
relatives and friends
on account of being intelligent
chorus
so it is refined not by socrates
to sit and chatter
casting aside the pursuits of the muses
and neglecting whats most important
in the art of tragedy
but to spend time idly
in pompous words
and frivolous wordscraping
is the act of a man going crazy
pluto
well then farewell aeschylus go
and save our city
with noble sentiments and educate
the dunces  theres plenty of them
and take this sword and give it to cleophon
and this rope to the tax collectors
myrmex and nicomachus
and this hemlock to archenomus and tell them
to come to me here quickly
and not to delay  and if they dont come
quickly by apollo ill
brand and hobble them
and with adeimantus son of leucolophus
ill send them quickly under the ground
aeschylus
ill do it  but you hand over
my throne to sophocles to guard
and preserve if i ever
come here again  for him i
judge to be second in talent
and remember that that villainous fellow
that liar that clown
will never sit on my throne
not even by accident
pluto
shine now for him
your sacred torches and escort
him extolling him with his songs
and dances
chorus
first grant bon voyage to the departing poet
as he rises to the light ye spirits under the earth
and grant to the city good ideas for great gains
for we would then cease completely from these great woes
and dire clashes in arms  but let cleophon
and anyone else who wants to fight in their ancestral fields
