after the death of cyrus cambyses inherited his throne he was the son of cyrus and of cassandane the daughter of pharnaspes for whom cyrus mourned deeply when she died before him and had all his subjects mourn also
cambyses was the son of this woman and of cyrus he considered the ionians and aeolians slaves inherited from his father and prepared an expedition against egypt taking with him some of these greek subjects besides others whom he ruled
now before psammetichus became king of egypt the egyptians believed that they were the oldest people on earth but ever since psammetichus became king and wished to find out which people were the oldest they have believed that the phrygians were older than they and they than everybody else
psammetichus when he was in no way able to learn by inquiry which people had first come into being devised a plan by which he took two newborn children of the common people and gave them to a shepherd to bring up among his flocks he gave instructions that no one was to speak a word in their hearing they were to stay by themselves in a lonely hut and in due time the shepherd was to bring goats and give the children their milk and do everything else necessary
psammetichus did this and gave these instructions because he wanted to hear what speech would first come from the children when they were past the age of indistinct babbling and he had his wish for one day when the shepherd had done as he was told for two years both children ran to him stretching out their hands and calling bekos as he opened the door and entered
when he first heard this he kept quiet about it but when coming often and paying careful attention he kept hearing this same word he told his master at last and brought the children into the kings presence as required psammetichus then heard them himself and asked to what language the word bekos belonged he found it to be a phrygian word signifying bread
reasoning from this the egyptians acknowledged that the phrygians were older than they this is the story which i heard from the priests of hephaestus temple at memphis the greeks say among many foolish things that psammetichus had the children reared by women whose tongues he had cut out
besides this story of the rearing of the children i also heard other things at memphis in conversation with the priests of hephaestus and i visited thebes
and heliopolis too for this very purpose because i wished to know if the people of those places would tell me the same story as the priests at memphis for the people of heliopolis are said to be the most learned of the egyptians
now such stories as i heard about the gods i am not ready to relate except their names for i believe that all men are equally knowledgeable about them and i shall say about them what i am constrained to say by the course of my history
but as to human affairs this was the account in which they all agreed the egyptians they said were the first men who reckoned by years and made the year consist of twelve divisions of the seasons they discovered this from the stars so they said and their reckoning is to my mind a juster one than that of the greeks for the greeks add an intercalary month every other year so that the seasons agree but the egyptians reckoning thirty days to each of the twelve months add five days in every year over and above the total and thus the completed circle of seasons is made to agree with the calendar
furthermore the egyptians they said first used the names of twelve gods which the greeks afterwards borrowed from them and it was they who first assigned to the several gods their altars and images and temples and first carved figures on stone most of this they showed me in fact to be the case the first human king of egypt they said was min
in his time all of egypt except the thebaic district was a marsh all the country that we now see was then covered by water north of lake moeris which is seven days journey up the river from the sea
and i think that their account of the country was true for even if a man has not heard it before he can readily see if he has sense that that egypt to which the greeks sail is land deposited for the egyptians the rivers gift not only the lower country but even the land as far as three days voyage above the lake which is of the same nature as the other although the priests did not say this too
for this is the nature of the land of egypt in the first place when you approach it from the sea and are still a days sail from land if you let down a sounding line you will bring up mud from a depth of eleven fathoms this shows that the deposit from the land reaches this far
further the length of the seacoast of egypt itself is sixty schoeni  of egypt that is as we judge it to be reaching from the plinthinete gulf to the serbonian marsh which is under the casian mountain between these there is this length of sixty schoeni
men that have scant land measure by feet those that have more by miles those that have much land by parasangs and those who have great abundance of it by schoeni
the parasang is three and three quarters miles and the schoenus which is an egyptian measure is twice that
by this reckoning then the seaboard of egypt will be four hundred and fifty miles in length inland from the sea as far as heliopolis egypt is a wide land all flat and watery and marshy from the sea up to heliopolis is a journey about as long as the way from the altar of the twelve gods at athens to the temple of olympian zeus at pisa
if a reckoning is made only a little difference of length not more than two miles will be found between these two journeys for the journey from athens to pisa is two miles short of two hundred which is the number of miles between the sea and heliopolis
beyond and above heliopolis egypt is a narrow land for it is bounded on the one side by the mountains of arabia which run north to south always running south towards the sea called the red sea in these mountains are the quarries that were hewn out for making the pyramids at memphis this way then the mountains run and end in the places of which i have spoken their greatest width from east to west as i learned by inquiry is a two months journey and their easternmost boundaries yield frankincense
such are these mountains on the side of libya egypt is bounded by another range of rocky mountains among which are the pyramids these are all covered with sand and run in the same direction as those arabian hills that run southward
beyond heliopolis there is no great distance in egypt that is the narrow land has a length of only fourteen days journey up the river between the aforesaid mountain ranges the land is level and where the plain is narrowest it seemed to me that there were no more than thirty miles between the arabian mountains and those that are called libyan beyond this egypt is a wide land again such is the nature of this country
from heliopolis to thebes
is nine days journey by river and the distance is six hundred and eight miles or eightyone schoeni
this then is a full statement of all the distances in egypt the seaboard is four hundred and fifty miles long and i will now declare the distance inland from the sea to thebes
it is seven hundred and sixtyfive miles and between thebes
and the city called elephantine there are two hundred and twentyfive miles
the greater portion then of this country of which i have spoken was land deposited for the egyptians as the priests told me and i myself formed the same judgment all that lies between the ranges of mountains above memphis to which i have referred seemed to me to have once been a gulf of the sea just as the country about ilion and teuthrania and ephesus and the plain of the maeander to compare these small things with great
for of the rivers that brought down the stuff to make these lands there is none worthy to be compared for greatness with even one of the mouths of the nile and the nile has five mouths
there are also other rivers not so great as the nile that have had great effects i could rehearse their names but principal among them is the achelous which flowing through acarnania and emptying into the sea has already made half of the echinades islands mainland
now in arabia not far from egypt there is a gulf extending inland from the sea called red  whose length and width are such as i shall show
in length from its inner end out to the wide sea it is a forty days voyage for a ship rowed by oars and in breadth it is half a days voyage at the widest every day the tides ebb and flow in it
i believe that where egypt is now there was once another such gulf this extended from the northern sea towards aethiopia and the other the arabian gulf of which i shall speak extended from the south towards syria the ends of these gulfs penetrated into the country near each other and but a little space of land separated them
now if the nile inclined to direct its current into this arabian gulf why should the latter not be silted up by it inside of twenty thousand years in fact i expect that it would be silted up inside of ten thousand years is it to be doubted then that in the ages before my birth a gulf even much greater than this should have been silted up by a river so great and so busy
as for egypt then i credit those who say it and myself very much believe it to be the case for i have seen that egypt projects into the sea beyond the neighboring land and shells are exposed to view on the mountains and things are coated with salt so that even the pyramids show it and the only sandy mountain in egypt is that which is above memphis
besides egypt is like neither the neighboring land of arabia nor libya not even like syria for syrians inhabit the seaboard of arabia it is a land of black and crumbling earth as if it were alluvial deposit carried down the river from aethiopia
but we know that the soil of libya is redder and somewhat sandy and arabia and syria are lands of clay and stones
this too that the priests told me about egypt is a strong proof when moeris was king if the river rose as much as thirteen feet it watered all of egypt below memphis moeris had not been dead nine hundred years when i heard this from the priests but now if the river does not rise at least twentysix or twentyfive feet the land is not flooded
and in my opinion the egyptians who inhabit the lands lower down the river than lake moeris and especially what is called the delta if this land of theirs rises in the same proportion and broadens likewise in extent and the nile no longer floods it will forever after be in the same straits as they themselves once said the greeks would be
for learning that all the greek land is watered by rain but not by river water like theirs they said that one day the greeks would be let down by what they counted on and miserably starve meaning that if heaven send no rain for the greeks and afflict them with drought the greeks will be overtaken by famine for there is no other source of water for them except zeus alone
and this prediction of the egyptians about the greeks was true enough but now let me show the prospect for the egyptians themselves if as i have already said the country below memphis for it is this which rises should increase in height in the same proportion as formerly will not the egyptians who inhabit it go hungry as there is no rain in their country and the river will be unable to inundate their fields
at present of course there are no people either in the rest of egypt or in the whole world who live from the soil with so little labor they do not have to break the land up with the plough or hoe or do any other work that other men do to get a crop the river rises of itself waters the fields and then sinks back again then each man sows his field and sends swine into it to tread down the seed and waits for the harvest then he has the swine thresh his grain and so garners it
now if we agree with the opinion of the ionians who say that only the delta is egypt and that its seaboard reaches from the socalled watchtower of perseus forty schoeni to the salters at pelusium while inland it stretches as far as the city of cercasorus where the nile divides and flows to pelusium and canobus and that all the rest of egypt is partly libya and partly arabia if we follow this account we can show that there was once no land for the egyptians
for we have seen that as the egyptians themselves say and as i myself judge the delta is alluvial land and but lately so to speak came into being then if there was once no land for them it was an idle notion that they were the oldest nation on earth and they need not have made that trial to see what language the children would first speak
i maintain rather that the egyptians did not come into existence together with what the ionians call the delta but have existed since the human race came into being and as the land grew in extent there were many of them who stayed behind and many who spread down over it be that as it may the theban district a land of seven hundred and sixtyfive miles in circumference was in the past called egypt
if then our judgment of this is right the ionians are in error concerning egypt but if their opinion is right then it is plain that they and the rest of the greeks cannot reckon truly when they divide the whole earth into three parts europe asia and libya
they must add to these a fourth part the delta of egypt if it belongs neither to asia nor to libya for by their showing the nile is not the river that separates asia and libya the nile divides at the apex of this delta so that this land must be between asia and libya
we leave the ionians opinion aside and our own judgment about the matter is this egypt is all that country which is inhabited by egyptians just as cilicia and assyria are the countries inhabited by cilicians and assyrians and we know of no boundary line rightly so called below asia and libya except the borders of the egyptians
but if we follow the belief of the greeks we shall consider all egypt commencing from the cataracts and the city of elephantine to be divided into two parts and to claim both the names the one a part of libya and the other of asia
for the nile beginning from the cataracts divides egypt into two parts as it flows to the sea now as far as the city cercasorus the nile flows in one channel but after that it parts into three
one of these which is called the pelusian mouth flows east the second flows west and is called the canobic mouth but the direct channel of the nile when the river in its downward course reaches the apex of the delta flows thereafter clean through the middle of the delta into the sea in this is seen the greatest and most famous part of its waters and it is called the sebennytic mouth
there are also two channels which separate themselves from the sebennytic and so flow into the sea by name the saïtic and the mendesian
the bolbitine and bucolic mouths are not natural but excavated channels
the response of oracle of ammon in fact bears witness to my opinion that egypt is of such an extent as i have argued i learned this by inquiry after my judgment was already formed about egypt
the men of the cities of marea and apis in the part of egypt bordering on libya believing themselves to be libyans and not egyptians and disliking the injunction of the religious law that forbade them to eat cows meat sent to ammon saying that they had no part of or lot with egypt for they lived they said outside the delta and did not consent to the ways of its people and they wished to be allowed to eat all foods
but the god forbade them all the land he said watered by the nile in its course was egypt and all who lived lower down than the city elephantine and drank the rivers water were egyptians such was the oracle given to them
when the nile is in flood it overflows not only the delta but also the lands called libyan and arabian as far as two days journey from either bank in places and sometimes more than this sometimes less concerning its nature i could not learn anything either from the priests or from any others
yet i was anxious to learn from them why the nile comes down with a rising flood for a hundred days from the summer solstice and when this number of days is passed sinks again with a diminishing stream so that the river is low for the whole winter until the summer solstice again
i was not able to get any information from any of the egyptians regarding this when i asked them what power the nile has to be contrary in nature to all other rivers i wished to know this and asked also why no breezes blew from it as from every other river
but some of the greeks wishing to be notable for cleverness put forward three opinions about this river two of which i would not even mention except just to show what they are
one of them maintains that the etesian winds are the cause of the river being in flood because they hinder the nile from emptying into the sea but there are many times when the etesian winds do not blow yet the nile does the same as before
and further if the etesian winds were the cause then the other rivers which flow contrary to those winds should be affected like the nile and even more so since being smaller they have a weaker current yet there are many rivers in syria and many in libya and they behave nothing like the nile
the second opinion is less grounded on knowledge than the previous though it is more marvellous to the ear according to it the river effects what it does because it flows from ocean which flows around the whole world
the third opinion is by far the most plausible yet the most erroneous of all it has no more truth in it than the others according to this the nile flows from where snows melt but it flows from libya through the midst of ethiopia and comes out into egypt
how can it flow from snow then seeing that it comes from the hottest places to lands that are for the most part cooler in fact for a man who can reason about such things the principal and strongest evidence that the river is unlikely to flow from snows is that the winds blowing from libya and ethiopia are hot
in the second place the country is rainless and frostless but after snow has fallen it has to rain within five days  so that if it snowed it would rain in these lands and thirdly the men of the country are black because of the heat
moreover kites and swallows live there all year round and cranes come every year to these places to winter there flying from the wintry weather of scythia now were there but the least fall of snow in this country through which the nile flows and where it rises none of these things would happen as necessity proves
the opinion about ocean is grounded in obscurity and needs no disproof for i know of no ocean river and i suppose that homer or some older poet invented this name and brought it into his poetry
if after having condemned the opinions proposed i must indicate what i myself think about these obscure matters i shall say why i think the nile floods in the summer during the winter the sun is driven by storms from his customary course and passes over the inland parts of libya
for the briefest demonstration everything has been said for whatever country this god is nearest or over it is likely that that land is very thirsty for water and that the local rivers are dried up
a lengthier demonstration goes as follows in its passage over the inland parts of libya the sun does this as the air is always clear in that region the land warm and the winds cool the sun does in its passage exactly as it would do in the summer passing through the middle of the heaven
it draws the water to itself and having done so expels it away to the inland regions and the winds catch it and scatter and dissolve it and as is to be expected those that blow from that country the south and the southwest are the most rainy of all winds
yet i think that the sun never lets go of all of the water that it draws up from the nile yearly but keeps some back near itself then as the winter becomes milder the sun returns to the middle of the heaven and after that draws from all rivers alike
meanwhile the other rivers are swollen to high flood by the quantity of water that falls into them from the sky because the country is rained on and cut into gullies but in the summer they are low lacking the rain and being drawn up too by the sun
but the nile being fed by no rain and being the only river drawn up by the sun in winter at this time falls far short of the height that it had in summer which is but natural for in summer all other waters too and not it alone are attracted to the sun but in the winter it alone is afflicted
i am convinced therefore that the sun is the cause of this phenomenon the dryness of the air in these parts is also caused by the sun in my opinion because it burns its way through it hence it is always summer in the inland part of libya
but were the stations of the seasons changed so that the south wind and the summer had their station where the north wind and winter are now set and the north wind was where the south wind is now if this were so the sun when driven from midheaven by the winter and the north wind would pass over the inland parts of europe as it now passes over libya and i think that in its passage over all europe it would have the same effect on the ister as it now does on the nile
and as to why no breeze blows from the river this is my opinion it is not natural that any breeze blow from very hot places breezes always come from that which is very cold
let this be then as it is and as it was in the beginning but as to the sources of the nile no one that conversed with me egyptian libyan or greek professed to know them except the recorder of the sacred treasures of athena in the egyptian city of saïs
i thought he was joking when he said that he had exact knowledge but this was his story between the city of syene in the thebaid and elephantine there are two hills with sharp peaks one called crophi and the other mophi
the springs of the nile which are bottomless rise between these hills half the water flows north towards egypt and the other half south towards ethiopia
he said that psammetichus king of egypt had put to the test whether the springs are bottomless for he had a rope of many thousand fathoms length woven and let down into the spring but he could not reach to the bottom
this recorder then if he spoke the truth showed i think that there are strong eddies and an upward flow of water such that with the stream rushing against the hills the soundingline when let down cannot reach bottom
i was unable to learn anything from anyone else but this much further i did learn by the most extensive investigation that i could make going as far as the city of elephantine to look myself and beyond that by question and hearsay
beyond elephantine as one travels inland the land rises here one must pass with the boat roped on both sides as men harness an ox and if the rope breaks the boat will be carried away by the strength of the current
this part of the river is a four days journey by boat and the nile here is twisty just as the maeander a distance of twelve schoeni must be passed in the foregoing manner after that you come to a level plain where there is an island in the nile called takhompso
the country above elephantine now begins to be inhabited by ethiopians half the people of the island are ethiopians and half egyptians near the island is a great lake on whose shores live nomadic ethiopians after crossing this you come to the stream of the nile which empties into this lake
then you disembark and journey along the river bank for forty days for there are sharp projecting rocks in the nile and many reefs through which no boat can pass
having traversed this part in forty days as i have said you take boat again and so travel for twelve days until you come to a great city called meroe which is said to be the capital of all ethiopia
the people of the place worship no other gods but zeus and dionysus these they greatly honor and they have a place of divination sacred to zeus they send out armies whenever and wherever this god through his oracle commands them
from this city you make a journey by water equal in distance to that by which you came from elephantine to the capital city of ethiopia and you come to the land of the deserters these deserters are called asmakh which translates in greek as those who stand on the left hand of the king
these once revolted and joined themselves to the ethiopians two hundred and forty thousand egyptians of fighting age the reason was as follows in the reign of psammetichus there were watchposts at elephantine facing ethiopia at daphnae of pelusium facing arabia and assyria and at marea facing libya
and still in my time the persians hold these posts as they were held in the days of psammetichus there are persian guards at elephantine and at daphnae now the egyptians had been on guard for three years and no one came to relieve them so organizing and making common cause they revolted from psammetichus and went to ethiopia
psammetichus heard of it and pursued them and when he overtook them he asked them in a long speech not to desert their children and wives and the gods of their fathers then one of them the story goes pointed to his genitals and said that wherever that was they would have wives and children
so they came to ethiopia and gave themselves up to the king of the country who to make them a gift in return told them to dispossess certain ethiopians with whom he was feuding and occupy their land these ethiopians then learned egyptian customs and have become mildermannered by intermixture with the egyptians
to a distance of four months travel by land and water then there is knowledge of the nile besides the part of it that is in egypt so many months as reckoning shows are found to be spent by one going from elephantine to the country of the deserters the river flows from the west and the suns setting beyond this no one has clear information to declare for all that country is desolate because of the heat
but i heard this from some men of cyrene who told me that they had gone to the oracle of ammon and conversed there with etearchus king of the ammonians and that from other subjects the conversation turned to the nile how no one knows the source of it then etearchus told them that once he had been visited by some nasamonians
these are a libyan people inhabiting the country of the syrtis and a little way to the east of the syrtis
when these nasamonians were asked on their arrival if they brought any news concerning the libyan desert they told etearchus that some sons of their leading men proud and violent youths when they came to manhood besides planning other wild adventures had chosen by lot five of their company to visit the deserts of libya and see whether they could see any farther than those who had seen the farthest
it must be known that the whole northern seacoast of libya from egypt as far as the promontory of soloeis which is the end of libya is inhabited throughout its length by libyans many tribes of them except the part held by greeks and phoenicians the region of libya that is above the sea and the inhabitants of the coast is infested by wild beasts and farther inland than the wildbeast country everything is sand waterless and desolate
when the young men left their companions being well supplied with water and provisions they journeyed first through the inhabited country and after passing this they came to the region of wild beasts
after this they travelled over the desert towards the west and crossed a wide sandy region until after many days they saw trees growing in a plain when they came to these and were picking the fruit of the trees they were met by little men of less than common stature who took them and led them away the nasamonians did not know these mens language nor did the escort know the language of the nasamonians
the men led them across great marshes after crossing which they came to a city where all the people were of a stature like that of the guides and black a great river ran past this city from the west towards the rising sun crocodiles could be seen in it
this is enough of the story told by etearchus the ammonian except he said that the nasamonians returned as the men of cyrene told me and that the people to whose country they came were all wizards
as to the river that ran past the city etearchus guessed it to be the nile and reason proves as much for the nile flows from libya right through the middle of it and as i guess reasoning about things unknown from visible signs it rises proportionally as far away as does the ister
for the ister flows from the land of the celts and the city of pyrene through the very middle of europe now the celts live beyond the pillars of heracles being neighbors of the cynesii who are the westernmost of all the peoples inhabiting europe
the ister then flows clean across europe and ends its course in the euxine sea at istria which is inhabited by milesian colonists
the ister since it flows through inhabited country is known from many reports but no one can speak of the source of the nile for libya though which it runs is uninhabited and desert regarding its course i have related everything that i could learn by inquiry and it issues into egypt now egypt lies about opposite to the mountainous part of cilicia
from there it is a straight five days journey for an unencumbered man to sinope on the euxine and sinope lies opposite the place where the ister falls into the sea thus i suppose the course of the nile in its passage through libya to be like the course of the ister
it is sufficient to say this much concerning the nile but concerning egypt i am going to speak at length because it has the most wonders and everywhere presents works beyond description therefore i shall say the more concerning egypt
just as the egyptians have a climate peculiar to themselves and their river is different in its nature from all other rivers so too have they instituted customs and laws contrary for the most part to those of the rest of mankind among them the women buy and sell the men stay at home and weave and whereas in weaving all others push the woof upwards the egyptians push it downwards
men carry burdens on their heads women on their shoulders women pass water standing men sitting they ease their bowels indoors and eat out of doors in the streets explaining that things unseemly but necessary should be done alone in private things not unseemly should be done openly
no woman is dedicated to the service of any god or goddess men are dedicated to all deities male or female sons are not compelled against their will to support their parents but daughters must do so though they be unwilling
everywhere else priests of the gods wear their hair long in egypt they are shaven for all other men the rule in mourning for the dead is that those most nearly concerned have their heads shaven egyptians are shaven at other times but after a death they let their hair and beard grow
the egyptians are the only people who keep their animals with them in the house whereas all others live on wheat and barley it is the greatest disgrace for an egyptian to live so they make food from a coarse grain which some call spelt
they knead dough with their feet and gather mud and dung with their hands the egyptians and those who have learned it from them are the only people who practise circumcision every man has two garments every woman only one
the rings and sheets of sails are made fast outside the boat elsewhere but inside it in egypt the greeks write and calculate from left to right the egyptians do the opposite yet they say that their way of writing is towards the right and the greek way towards the left they employ two kinds of writing one is called sacred the other demotic
they are religious beyond measure more than any other people and the following are among their customs they drink from cups of bronze which they clean out daily this is done not by some but by all
they are especially careful always to wear newlywashed linen they practise circumcision for cleanliness sake for they would rather be clean than more becoming their priests shave the whole body every other day so that no lice or anything else foul may infest them as they attend upon the gods
the priests wear a single linen garment and sandals of papyrus they may have no other kind of clothing or footwear twice a day and twice every night they wash in cold water their religious observances are one may say innumerable
but also they receive many benefits they do not consume or spend anything of their own sacred food is cooked for them beef and goose are brought in great abundance to each man every day and wine of grapes is given to them too they may not eat fish
the egyptians sow no beans in their country if any grow they will not eat them either raw or cooked the priests cannot endure even to see them considering beans an unclean kind of legume many not only one are dedicated to the service of each god one of these is the high priest and when a high priest dies his son succeeds to his office
they believe that bulls belong to epaphus and for this reason scrutinize them as follows if they see even one black hair on them the bull is considered impure
one of the priests appointed to the task examines the beast making it stand and lie and drawing out its tongue to determine whether it is clean of the stated signs which i shall indicate hereafter he looks also to the hairs of the tail to see if they grow naturally
if it is clean in all these respects the priest marks it by wrapping papyrus around the horns then smears it with sealingearth and stamps it with his ring and after this they lead the bull away but the penalty is death for sacrificing a bull that the priest has not marked such is the manner of approving the beast i will now describe how it is sacrificed
after leading the marked beast to the altar where they will sacrifice it they kindle a fire then they pour wine on the altar over the victim and call upon the god then they cut its throat and having done so sever the head from the body
they flay the carcass of the victim then invoke many curses on its head which they carry away where there is a market and greek traders in it the head is taken to the market and sold where there are no greeks it is thrown into the river
the imprecation which they utter over the heads is that whatever ill threatens those who sacrifice or the whole of egypt fall upon that head
in respect of the heads of sacrificed beasts and the libation of wine the practice of all egyptians is the same in all sacrifices and from this ordinance no egyptian will taste of the head of anything that had life
but in regard to the disembowelling and burning of the victims there is a different way for each sacrifice i shall now however speak of that goddess whom they consider the greatest and in whose honor they keep highest festival
after praying in the foregoing way they take the whole stomach out of the flayed bull leaving the entrails and the fat in the carcass and cut off the legs the end of the loin the shoulders and the neck
having done this they fill what remains of the carcass with pure bread honey raisins figs frankincense myrrh and other kinds of incense and then burn it pouring a lot of oil on it
they fast before the sacrifice and while it is burning they all make lamentation and when their lamentation is over they set out a meal of what is left of the victim
all egyptians sacrifice unblemished bulls and bullcalves they may not sacrifice cows these are sacred to isis
for the images of isis are in womans form horned like a cow exactly as the greeks picture io and cows are held by far the most sacred of all beasts of the herd by all egyptians alike
for this reason no egyptian man or woman will kiss a greek man or use a knife or a spit or a cauldron belonging to a greek or taste the flesh of an unblemished bull that has been cut up with a greek knife
cattle that die are dealt with in the following way cows are cast into the river bulls are buried by each city in its suburbs with one or both horns uncovered for a sign then when the carcass is decomposed and the time appointed is at hand a boat comes to each city from the island called prosopitis
an island in the delta nine schoeni in circumference there are many other towns on prosopitis the one from which the boats come to gather the bones of the bulls is called atarbekhis a temple of aphrodite stands in it of great sanctity
from this town many go out some to one town and some to another to dig up the bones which they then carry away and all bury in one place as they bury the cattle so do they all other beasts at death such is their ordinance respecting these also for they too may not be killed
all that have a temple of zeus of thebes
or are of the theban district sacrifice goats but will not touch sheep
for no gods are worshipped by all egyptians in common except isis and osiris who they say is dionysus these are worshipped by all alike those who have a temple of mendes or are of the mendesian district sacrifice sheep but will not touch goats
the thebans and those who by the theban example will not touch sheep give the following reason for their ordinance they say that heracles wanted very much to see zeus and that zeus did not want to be seen by him but that finally when heracles prayed zeus contrived
to show himself displaying the head and wearing the fleece of a ram which he had flayed and beheaded it is from this that the egyptian images of zeus have a rams head and in this the egyptians are imitated by the ammonians who are colonists from egypt and ethiopia and speak a language compounded of the tongues of both countries
it was from this i think that the ammonians got their name too for the egyptians call zeus amon the thebans then consider rams sacred for this reason and do not sacrifice them
but one day a year at the festival of zeus they cut in pieces and flay a single ram and put the fleece on the image of zeus as in the story then they bring an image of heracles near it having done this all that are at the temple mourn for the ram and then bury it in a sacred coffin
concerning heracles i heard it said that he was one of the twelve gods but nowhere in egypt could i hear anything about the other heracles whom the greeks know
i have indeed a lot of other evidence that the name of heracles did not come from hellas to egypt but from egypt to hellas and in hellas to those greeks who gave the name heracles to the son of amphitryon besides this that amphitryon and alcmene the parents of this heracles were both egyptian by descent  and that the egyptians deny knowing the names poseidon and the dioscuri nor are these gods reckoned among the gods of egypt
yet if they got the name of any deity from the greeks of these not least but in particular would they preserve a recollection if indeed they were already making sea voyages and some greeks too were seafaring men as i expect and judge so that the names of these gods would have been even better known to the egyptians than the name of heracles
but heracles is a very ancient god in egypt as the egyptians themselves say the change of the eight gods to the twelve one of whom they acknowledge heracles to be was made seventeen thousand years before the reign of amasis
moreover wishing to get clear information about this matter where it was possible so to do i took ship for tyre in phoenicia where i had learned by inquiry that there was a holy temple of heracles
there i saw it richly equipped with many other offerings besides two pillars one of refined gold one of emerald a great pillar that shone at night and in conversation with the priests i asked how long it was since their temple was built
i found that their account did not tally with the belief of the greeks either for they said that the temple of the god was founded when tyre first became a city and that was two thousand three hundred years ago at tyre i saw yet another temple of the socalled thasian heracles
then i went to thasos too where i found a temple of heracles built by the phoenicians who made a settlement there when they voyaged in search of europe now they did so as much as five generations before the birth of heracles the son of amphitryon in hellas
therefore what i have discovered by inquiry plainly shows that heracles is an ancient god and furthermore those greeks i think are most in the right who have established and practise two worships of heracles sacrificing to one heracles as to an immortal and calling him the olympian but to the other bringing offerings as to a dead hero
and the greeks say many other illconsidered things too among them this is a silly story which they tell about heracles that when he came to egypt the egyptians crowned him and led him out in a procession to sacrifice him to zeus and for a while they say he followed quietly but when they started in on him at the altar he resisted and killed them all
now it seems to me that by this story the greeks show themselves altogether ignorant of the character and customs of the egyptians for how should they sacrifice men when they are forbidden to sacrifice even beasts except swine and bulls and bullcalves if they are unblemished and geese
and furthermore as heracles was alone and still only a man as they say how is it natural that he should kill many myriads in talking so much about this may i keep the goodwill of gods and heroes
this is why the egyptians of whom i have spoken sacrifice no goats male or female the mendesians reckon pan among the eight gods who they say were before the twelve gods
now in their painting and sculpture the image of pan is made with the head and the legs of a goat as among the greeks not that he is thought to be in fact such or unlike other gods but why they represent him so i have no wish to say
the mendesians consider all goats sacred the male even more than the female and goatherds are held in special estimation one hegoat is most sacred of all when he dies it is ordained that there should be great mourning in all the mendesian district
in the egyptian language mendes is the name both for the hegoat and for pan in my lifetime a strange thing occurred in this district a hegoat had intercourse openly with a woman this came to be publicly known
swine are held by the egyptians to be unclean beasts in the first place if an egyptian touches a hog in passing he goes to the river and dips himself in it clothed as he is and in the second place swineherds though native born egyptians are alone of all men forbidden to enter any egyptian temple nor will any give a swineherd his daughter in marriage nor take a wife from their women but swineherds intermarry among themselves
nor do the egyptians think it right to sacrifice swine to any god except the moon and dionysus to these they sacrifice their swine at the same time in the same season of full moon then they eat the meat the egyptians have an explanation of why they sacrifice swine at this festival yet abominate them at others i know it but it is not fitting that i relate it
but this is how they sacrifice swine to the moon the sacrificer lays the end of the tail and the spleen and the caul together and covers them up with all the fat that he finds around the belly then consigns it all to the fire as for the rest of the flesh they eat it at the time of full moon when they sacrifice the victim but they will not taste it on any other day poor men with but slender means mold swine out of dough which they then take and sacrifice
to dionysus on the evening of his festival everyone offers a piglet which he kills before his door and then gives to the swineherd who has sold it for him to take away
the rest of the festival of dionysus is observed by the egyptians much as it is by the greeks except for the dances but in place of the phallus they have invented the use of puppets two feet high moved by strings the male member nodding and nearly as big as the rest of the body which are carried about the villages by women a fluteplayer goes ahead the women follow behind singing of dionysus
why the male member is so large and is the only part of the body that moves there is a sacred legend that explains
now then it seems to me that melampus son of amytheon was not ignorant of but was familiar with this sacrifice for melampus was the one who taught the greeks the name of dionysus and the way of sacrificing to him and the phallic procession he did not exactly unveil the subject taking all its details into consideration for the teachers who came after him made a fuller revelation but it was from him that the greeks learned to bear the phallus along in honor of dionysus and they got their present practice from his teaching
i say then that melampus acquired the prophetic art being a discerning man and that besides many other things which he learned from egypt he also taught the greeks things concerning dionysus altering few of them for i will not say that what is done in egypt in connection with the god and what is done among the greeks originated independently for they would then be of an hellenic character and not recently introduced
nor again will i say that the egyptians took either this or any other custom from the greeks but i believe that melampus learned the worship of dionysus chiefly from cadmus of tyre and those who came with cadmus from phoenicia to the land now called boeotia
in fact the names of nearly all the gods came to hellas from egypt for i am convinced by inquiry that they have come from foreign parts and i believe that they came chiefly from egypt
except the names of poseidon and the dioscuri as i have already said and hera and hestia and themis and the graces and the nereids the names of all the gods have always existed in egypt i only say what the egyptians themselves say the gods whose names they say they do not know were as i think named by the pelasgians except poseidon the knowledge of whom they learned from the libyans
alone of all nations the libyans have had among them the name of poseidon from the beginning and they have always honored this god the egyptians however are not accustomed to pay any honors to heroes
these customs then and others besides which i shall indicate were taken by the greeks from the egyptians it was not so with the ithyphallic images of hermes the production of these came from the pelasgians from whom the athenians were the first greeks to take it and then handed it on to others
for the athenians were then already counted as greeks when the pelasgians came to live in the land with them and thereby began to be considered as greeks whoever has been initiated into the rites of the cabeiri which the samothracians learned from the pelasgians and now practice understands what my meaning is
samothrace was formerly inhabited by those pelasgians who came to live among the athenians and it is from them that the samothracians take their rites
the athenians then were the first greeks to make ithyphallic images of hermes and they did this because the pelasgians taught them the pelasgians told a certain sacred tale about this which is set forth in the samothracian mysteries
formerly in all their sacrifices the pelasgians called upon gods without giving name or appellation to any i know this because i was told at dodona for as yet they had not heard of such they called them gods from the fact that besides setting everything in order they maintained all the dispositions
then after a long while first they learned the names of the rest of the gods which came to them from egypt and much later the name of dionysus and presently they asked the oracle at dodona about the names for this place of divination held to be the most ancient in hellas was at that time the only one
when the pelasgians then asked at dodona whether they should adopt the names that had come from foreign parts the oracle told them to use the names from that time onwards they used the names of the gods in their sacrifices and the greeks received these later from the pelasgians
but whence each of the gods came to be or whether all had always been and how they appeared in form they did not know until yesterday or the day before so to speak
for i suppose hesiod and homer flourished not more than four hundred years earlier than i and these are the ones who taught the greeks the descent of the gods and gave the gods their names and determined their spheres and functions and described their outward forms
but the poets who are said to have been earlier than these men were in my opinion later the earlier part of all this is what the priestesses of dodona tell the later that which concerns hesiod and homer is what i myself say
but about the oracles in hellas and that one which is in libya the egyptians give the following account the priests of zeus of thebes
told me that two priestesses had been carried away from thebes
by phoenicians one they said they had heard was taken away and sold in libya the other in hellas these women they said were the first founders of places of divination in the aforesaid countries
when i asked them how it was that they could speak with such certain knowledge they said in reply that their people had sought diligently for these women and had never been able to find them but had learned later the story which they were telling me
that then i heard from the theban priests and what follows the prophetesses of dodona say that two black doves had come flying from thebes
in egypt one to libya and one to dodona
the latter settled on an oak tree and there uttered human speech declaring that a place of divination from zeus must be made there the people of dodona understood that the message was divine and therefore established the oracular shrine
the dove which came to libya told the libyans they say to make an oracle of ammon this also is sacred to zeus such was the story told by the dodonaean priestesses the eldest of whom was promeneia and the next timarete and the youngest nicandra and the rest of the servants of the temple at dodona similarly held it true
but my own belief about it is this if the phoenicians did in fact carry away the sacred women and sell one in libya and one in hellas then in my opinion the place where this woman was sold in what is now hellas but was formerly called pelasgia was thesprotia
and then being a slave there she established a shrine of zeus under an oak that was growing there for it was reasonable that as she had been a handmaid of the temple of zeus at thebes
she would remember that temple in the land to which she had come
after this as soon as she understood the greek language she taught divination and she said that her sister had been sold in libya by the same phoenicians who sold her
i expect that these women were called doves by the people of dodona because they spoke a strange language and the people thought it like the cries of birds
then the woman spoke what they could understand and that is why they say that the dove uttered human speech as long as she spoke in a foreign tongue they thought her voice was like the voice of a bird for how could a dove utter the speech of men the tale that the dove was black signifies that the woman was egyptian
the fashions of divination at thebes
of egypt and at dodona are like one another moreover the practice of divining from the sacrificed victim has also come from egypt
it would seem too that the egyptians were the first people to establish solemn assemblies and processions and services the greeks learned all that from them i consider this proved because the egyptian ceremonies are manifestly very ancient and the greek are of recent origin
the egyptians hold solemn assemblies not once a year but often the principal one of these and the most enthusiastically celebrated is that in honor of artemis at the town of bubastis  and the next is that in honor of isis at busiris
this town is in the middle of the egyptian delta and there is in it a very great temple of isis who is demeter in the greek language
the third greatest festival is at saïs in honor of athena the fourth is the festival of the sun at heliopolis the fifth of leto at buto and the sixth of ares at papremis
when the people are on their way to bubastis they go by river a great number in every boat men and women together some of the women make a noise with rattles others play flutes all the way while the rest of the women and the men sing and clap their hands
as they travel by river to bubastis whenever they come near any other town they bring their boat near the bank then some of the women do as i have said while some shout mockery of the women of the town others dance and others stand up and lift their skirts they do this whenever they come alongside any riverside town
but when they have reached bubastis they make a festival with great sacrifices and more wine is drunk at this feast than in the whole year besides it is customary for men and women but not children to assemble there to the number of seven hundred thousand as the people of the place say
this is what they do there i have already described how they keep the feast of isis at busiris there after the sacrifice all the men and women lament in countless numbers but it is not pious for me to say who it is for whom they lament
carians who live in egypt do even more than this inasmuch as they cut their foreheads with knives and by this they show that they are foreigners and not egyptians
when they assemble at saïs on the night of the sacrifice they keep lamps burning outside around their houses these lamps are saucers full of salt and oil on which the wick floats and they burn all night this is called the feast of lamps
egyptians who do not come to this are mindful on the night of sacrifice to keep their own lamps burning and so they are alight not only at saïs but throughout egypt a sacred tale is told showing why this night is lit up thus and honored
when the people go to heliopolis and buto they offer sacrifice only at papremis sacrifice is offered and rites performed just as elsewhere but when the sun is setting a few of the priests hover about the image while most of them go and stand in the entrance to the temple with clubs of wood in their hands others more than a thousand men fulfilling vows who also carry wooden clubs stand in a mass opposite
the image of the god in a little gilded wooden shrine they carry away on the day before this to another sacred building the few who are left with the image draw a fourwheeled wagon conveying the shrine and the image that is in the shrine the others stand in the space before the doors and do not let them enter while the vowkeepers taking the side of the god strike them who defend themselves
a fierce fight with clubs breaks out there and they are hit on their heads and many i expect even die from their wounds although the egyptians said that nobody dies
the natives say that they made this assembly a custom from the following incident the mother of ares lived in this temple ares had been raised apart from her and came when he grew up wishing to visit his mother but as her attendants kept him out and would not let him pass never having seen him before ares brought men from another town manhandled the attendants and went in to his mother from this they say this hitting for ares became a custom in the festival
furthermore it was the egyptians who first made it a matter of religious observance not to have intercourse with women in temples or to enter a temple after such intercourse without washing nearly all other peoples are less careful in this matter than are the egyptians and greeks and consider a man to be like any other animal
for beasts and birds they say are seen to mate both in the temples and in the sacred precincts now were this displeasing to the god the beasts would not do so this is the reason given by others for practices which i for my part dislike
but the egyptians in this and in all other matters are exceedingly strict against desecration of their temples
although egypt has libya on its borders it is not a country of many animals all of them are held sacred some of these are part of mens households and some not but if i were to say why they are left alone as sacred i should end up talking of matters of divinity which i am especially averse to treating i have never touched upon such except where necessity has compelled me
but i will indicate how it is customary to deal with the animals men and women are appointed guardians to provide nourishment for each kind respectively a son inherits this office from his father
townsfolk in each place when they pay their vows pray to the god to whom the animal is dedicated shaving all or one half or one third of their childrens heads and weighing the hair in a balance against a sum of silver then the weight in silver of the hair is given to the female guardian of the creatures who buys fish with it and feeds them
thus food is provided for them whoever kills one of these creatures intentionally is punished with death if he kills accidentally he pays whatever penalty the priests appoint whoever kills an ibis or a hawk intentionally or not must die for it
there are many household animals and there would be many more were it not for what happens among the cats when the females have a litter they are no longer receptive to the males those that seek to have intercourse with them cannot
so their recourse is to steal and carry off and kill the kittens but they do not eat what they have killed the mothers deprived of their young and desiring to have more will then approach the males for they are creatures that love offspring
and when a fire breaks out very strange things happen among the cats the egyptians stand around in a broken line thinking more of the cats than of quenching the burning but the cats slip through or leap over the men and spring into the fire
when this happens there is great mourning in egypt the occupants of a house where a cat has died a natural death shave their eyebrows and no more where a dog has died the head and the whole body are shaven
dead cats are taken away to sacred buildings in the town of bubastis where they are embalmed and buried female dogs are buried by the townsfolk in their own towns in sacred coffins and the like is done with mongooses shrewmice and hawks are taken away to buto ibises to the city of hermes
there are few bears and the wolves are little bigger than foxes both these are buried wherever they are found lying
the nature of crocodiles is as follows for the four winter months it eats nothing it has four feet and lives both on land and in the water for it lays eggs and hatches them out on land and spends the greater part of the day on dry ground and the night in the river the water being warmer than the air and dew
no mortal creature of all which we know grows from so small a beginning to such greatness for its eggs are not much bigger than goose eggs and the young crocodile is of a proportional size but it grows to a length of twentyeight feet and more
it has eyes like pigs eyes and long protruding teeth it is the only animal that has no tongue it does not move the lower jaw but brings the upper jaw down upon the lower uniquely among beasts
it also has strong claws and a scaly impenetrable hide on its back it is blind in the water but very keen of sight in the air since it lives in the water its mouth is all full of leeches all birds and beasts flee from it except the sandpiper  with which it is at peace because this bird does the crocodile a service
for whenever the crocodile comes ashore out of the water and then opens its mouth and it does this mostly to catch the west wind the sandpiper goes into its mouth and eats the leeches the crocodile is pleased by this service and does the sandpiper no harm
some of the egyptians consider crocodiles sacred others do not but treat them as enemies those who live near thebes
and lake moeris consider them very sacred
every household raises one crocodile trained to be tame they put ornaments of glass and gold on its ears and bracelets on its forefeet provide special food and offerings for it and give the creatures the best of treatment while they live after death the crocodiles are embalmed and buried in sacred coffins
but around elephantine they are not held sacred and are even eaten the egyptians do not call them crocodiles but khampsae the ionians named them crocodiles from their resemblance to the lizards which they have in their walls
there are many different ways of crocodile hunting i will write of the way that i think most worth mentioning the hunter baits a hook with a hogs back and lets it float into the midst of the river he himself stays on the bank with a young live pig which he beats
hearing the squeals of the pig the crocodile goes after the sound and meets the bait which it swallows then the hunters pull the line when the crocodile is drawn ashore first of all the hunter smears its eyes over with mud when this is done the quarry is very easily mastered no light matter without that
hippopotamuses are sacred in the district of papremis but not elsewhere in egypt they present the following appearance fourfooted with cloven hooves like cattle bluntnosed with a horses mane visible tusks a horses tail and voice big as the biggest bull their hide is so thick that when it is dried spearshafts are made of it
otters are found in the river too which the egyptians consider sacred and they consider sacred that fish too which is called the scalefish and the eel these and the foxgoose among birds are said to be sacred to the god of the nile
there is another sacred bird too whose name is phoenix i myself have never seen it only pictures of it for the bird seldom comes into egypt once in five hundred years as the people of heliopolis say
it is said that the phoenix comes when his father dies if the picture truly shows his size and appearance his plumage is partly golden and partly red he is most like an eagle in shape and size
what they say this bird manages to do is incredible to me flying from arabia to the temple of the sun they say he conveys his father encased in myrrh and buries him at the temple of the sun
this is how he conveys him he first molds an egg of myrrh as heavy as he can carry then tries lifting it and when he has tried it he then hollows out the egg and puts his father into it and plasters over with more myrrh the hollow of the egg into which he has put his father which is the same in weight with his father lying in it and he conveys him encased to the temple of the sun in egypt this is what they say this bird does
near thebes
there are sacred snakes harmless to men small in size and bearing two horns on the top of their heads these when they die are buried in the temple of zeus to whom they are said to be sacred
there is a place in arabia not far from the town of buto where i went to learn about the winged serpents when i arrived there i saw innumerable bones and backbones of serpents many heaps of backbones great and small and even smaller
this place where the backbones lay scattered is where a narrow mountain pass opens into a great plain which adjoins the plain of egypt
winged serpents are said to fly from arabia at the beginning of spring making for egypt but the ibis birds encounter the invaders in this pass and kill them
the arabians say that the ibis is greatly honored by the egyptians for this service and the egyptians give the same reason for honoring these birds
now this is the appearance of the ibis it is all quite black with the legs of a crane and a beak sharply hooked and is as big as a landrail such is the appearance of the ibis which fights with the serpents those that most associate with men for there are two kinds of ibis
have the whole head and neck bare of feathers their plumage is white except the head and neck and wingtips and tail these being quite black the legs and beak of the bird are like those of the other ibis the serpents are like watersnakes
their wings are not feathered but very like the wings of a bati have now said enough concerning creatures that are sacred
among the egyptians themselves those who live in the cultivated country are the most assiduous of all men at preserving the memory of the past and none whom i have questioned are so skilled in history
they practice the following way of life for three consecutive days in every month they purge themselves pursuing health by means of emetics and drenches for they think that it is from the food they eat that all sicknesses come to men
even without this the egyptians are the healthiest of all men next to the libyans the explanation of which in my opinion is that the climate in all seasons is the same for change is the great cause of mens falling sick more especially changes of seasons
they eat bread making loaves which they call cyllestis of coarse grain for wine they use a drink made from barley for they have no vines in their country they eat fish either raw and sundried or preserved with brine
quails and ducks and small birds are salted and eaten raw all other kinds of birds as well as fish except those that the egyptians consider sacred are eaten roasted or boiled
after rich mens repasts a man carries around an image in a coffin painted and carved in exact imitation of a corpse two or four feet long this he shows to each of the company saying while you drink and enjoy look on this for to this state you must come when you die such is the custom at their symposia
they keep the customs of their fathers adding none to them among other notable customs of theirs is this that they have one song the linussong which is sung in phoenicia and cyprus and elsewhere each nation has a name of its own for this
but it happens to be the same song that the greeks sing and call linus so that of many things in egypt that amaze me one is where did the egyptians get linus plainly they have always sung this song but in egyptian linus is called maneros
the egyptians told me that maneros was the only son of their first king who died prematurely and this dirge was sung by the egyptians in his honor and this they said was their earliest and their only chant
there is a custom too which no greeks except the lacedaemonians have in common with the egyptians younger men encountering their elders yield the way and stand aside and rise from their seats for them when they approach
but they are like none of the greeks in this passersby do not address each other but salute by lowering the hand to the knee
they wear linen tunics with fringes hanging about the legs called calasiris and loose white woolen mantles over these but nothing woolen is brought into temples or buried with them that is impious
they agree in this with practices called orphic and bacchic but in fact egyptian and pythagorean for it is impious too for one partaking of these rites to be buried in woolen wrappings there is a sacred legend about this
other things originating with the egyptians are these each month and day belong to one of the gods and according to the day of ones birth are determined how one will fare and how one will end and what one will be like those greeks occupied with poetry exploit this
more portents have been discovered by them than by all other peoples when a portent occurs they take note of the outcome and write it down and if something of a like kind happens again they think it will have a like result
as to the art of divination among them it belongs to no man but to some of the gods there are in their country oracles of heracles apollo athena artemis ares and zeus and of leto the most honored of all in the town of buto nevertheless they have several ways of divination not just one
the practice of medicine is so specialized among them that each physician is a healer of one disease and no more all the country is full of physicians some of the eye some of the teeth some of what pertains to the belly and some of internal diseases
they mourn and bury the dead like this whenever a man of note is lost to his house by death all the women of the house daub their faces or heads with mud then they leave the corpse in the house and roam about the city lamenting with their garments girt around them and their breasts showing and with them all the women of their relatives
elsewhere the men lament with garments girt likewise when this is done they take the dead body to be embalmed
there are men whose sole business this is and who have this special craft
when a dead body is brought to them they show those who brought it wooden models of corpses painted likenesses the most perfect way of embalming belongs they say to one whose name it would be impious for me to mention in treating such a matter the second way which they show is less perfect than the first and cheaper and the third is the least costly of all having shown these they ask those who brought the body in which way they desire to have it prepared
having agreed on a price the bearers go away and the workmen left alone in their place embalm the body if they do this in the most perfect way they first draw out part of the brain through the nostrils with an iron hook and inject certain drugs into the rest
then making a cut near the flank with a sharp knife of ethiopian stone they take out all the intestines and clean the belly rinsing it with palm wine and bruised spices
they sew it up again after filling the belly with pure ground myrrh and casia and any other spices except frankincense after doing this they conceal the body for seventy days embalmed in saltpetre no longer time is allowed for the embalming
and when the seventy days have passed they wash the body and wrap the whole of it in bandages of fine linen cloth anointed with gum which the egyptians mostly use instead of glue
then they give the dead man back to his friends these make a hollow wooden figure like a man in which they enclose the corpse shut it up and keep it safe in a coffinchamber placed erect against a wall
that is how they prepare the dead in the most costly way those who want the middle way and shun the costly they prepare as follows
the embalmers charge their syringes with cedar oil and fill the belly of the dead man with it without making a cut or removing the intestines but injecting the fluid through the anus and preventing it from running out then they embalm the body for the appointed days on the last day they drain the belly of the cedar oil which they put in before
it has such great power as to bring out with it the internal organs and intestines all dissolved meanwhile the flesh is eaten away by the saltpetre and in the end nothing is left of the body but hide and bones then the embalmers give back the dead body with no more ado
the third manner of embalming the preparation of the poorer dead is this they cleanse the belly with a purge embalm the body for the seventy days and then give it back to be taken away
wives of notable men and women of great beauty and reputation are not at once given to the embalmers but only after they have been dead for three or four days
this is done to deter the embalmers from having intercourse with the women for it is said that one was caught having intercourse with the fresh corpse of a woman and was denounced by his fellowworkman
anyone egyptian or foreigner known to have been carried off by a crocodile or drowned by the river itself must by all means be embalmed and wrapped as attractively as possible and buried in a sacred coffin by the people of the place where he is cast ashore
none of his relatives or friends may touch him but his body is considered something more than human and is handled and buried by the priests of the nile themselves
the egyptians shun using greek customs and generally speaking the customs of all other peoples as well yet though the rest are wary of this there is a great city called khemmis in the theban district near the new city
in this city is a square temple of perseus son of danae in a grove of palm trees before this temple stand great stone columns and at the entrance two great stone statues in the outer court there is a shrine with an image of perseus standing in it
the people of this khemmis say that perseus is seen often up and down this land and often within the temple and that the sandal he wears which is four feet long keeps turning up and that when it does turn up all egypt prospers
this is what they say and their doings in honor of perseus are greek inasmuch as they celebrate games that include every form of contest and offer animals and cloaks and skins as prizes
when i asked why perseus appeared only to them and why unlike all other egyptians they celebrate games they told me that perseus was by lineage of their city for danaus and lynceus who travelled to greece were of khemmis and they traced descent from these down to perseus
they told how he came to khemmis too when he came to egypt for the reason alleged by the greeks as well namely to bring the gorgons head from libya and recognized all his relatives and how he had heard the name of khemmis from his mother before he came to egypt it was at his bidding they said that they celebrated the games
all these are the customs of egyptians who live above the marsh country those who inhabit the marshes have the same customs as the rest of egyptians even that each man has one wife just like greeks they have besides devised means to make their food less costly
when the river is in flood and flows over the plains many lilies which the egyptians call lotus grow in the water they gather these and dry them in the sun then they crush the poppylike center of the plant and bake loaves of it
the root of this lotus is edible also and of a sweetish taste it is round and the size of an apple
other lilies grow in the river too that are like roses the fruit of these is found in a calyx springing from the root by a separate stalk and is most like a comb made by wasps this produces many edible seeds as big as olive pits which are eaten both fresh and dried
they also use the byblus which grows annually it is gathered from the marshes the top of it cut off and put to other uses and the lower part about twenty inches long eaten or sold those who wish to use the byblus at its very best roast it before eating in a redhot oven some live on fish alone they catch the fish take out the intestines then dry them in the sun and eat them dried
fish that go in schools are seldom born in rivers they are raised in the lakes and this is how they behave when the desire of spawning comes on them they swim out to sea in schools the males leading and throwing out their milt while the females come after and swallow and conceive from it
when the females have grown heavy in the sea then all the fish swim back to their own haunts but the same no longer lead now the leadership goes to the females they go before in a school as the males had and now and then throw off some of their eggs which are like milletseeds which the males devour as they follow these milletseeds or eggs are fish
the fish that are reared come from the eggs that survive and are not devoured those fish that are caught while swimming seawards show bruises on the left side of their heads those that are caught returning on the right side
this happens because they keep close to the left bank as they swim seawards and keep to the same bank also on their return grazing it and keeping in contact with it as well as they can i suppose lest the current make them miss their way
when the nile begins to rise hollow and marshy places near the river are the first to begin to fill the water trickling through from the river and as soon as they are flooded they are suddenly full of little fishes
where these probably come from i believe that i can guess when the nile falls the fish have dropped their eggs into the mud before they leave with the last of the water and when in the course of time the flood comes again in the following year from these eggs at once come the fish
so much then for the fish the egyptians who live around the marshes use an oil drawn from the castorberry which they call kiki they sow this plant which grows wild in hellas on the banks of the rivers and lakes
sown in egypt it produces abundant fruit though malodorous when they gather this some bruise and press it others boil after roasting it and collect the liquid that comes from it this is thick and useful as oil for lamps and gives off a strong smell
against the mosquitos that abound the following have been devised by them those who dwell higher up than the marshy country are well served by the towers where they ascend to sleep for the winds prevent the mosquitos from flying aloft
those living about the marshes have a different recourse instead of the towers every one of them has a net with which he catches fish by day and at night he sets it around the bed where he rests then creeps under it and sleeps
if he sleeps wrapped in a garment or cloth the mosquitos bite through it but through the net they absolutely do not even venture
the boats in which they carry cargo are made of the acacia which is most like the lotus of cyrene in form and its sap is gum of this tree they cut logs of four feet long and lay them like courses of bricks and build the boat
by fastening these four foot logs to long and closeset stakes and having done so they set crossbeams athwart and on the logs they use no ribs they caulk the seams within with byblus
there is one rudder passing through a hole in the boats keel the mast is of acaciawood and the sails of byblus these boats cannot move upstream unless a brisk breeze continues they are towed from the bank but downstream they are managed thus
they have a raft made of tamarisk wood fastened together with matting of reeds and a pierced stone of about two talents weight the raft is let go to float down ahead of the boat connected to it by a rope and the stone is connected by a rope to the after part of the boat
so driven by the current the raft floats swiftly and tows the baris which is the name of these boats and the stone dragging behind on the river bottom keeps the boats course straight there are many of these boats some are of many thousand talents burden
when the nile overflows the land only the towns are seen high and dry above the water very like the islands in the aegean sea these alone stand out the rest of egypt being a sheet of water so when this happens folk are not ferried as usual in the course of the stream but clean over the plain
indeed the boat going up from naucratis to memphis passes close by the pyramids themselves though the course does not go by here but by the deltas point and the town cercasorus but your voyage from the sea and canobus to naucratis will take you over the plain near the town of anthylla and that which is called arkhandrus town
anthylla is a town of some reputation and is especially assigned to the consort of the reigning king of egypt to provide her shoes this has been done since egypt has been under persian dominion
the other town i think is named after arkhandrus son of phthius the achaean and soninlaw of danaus for it is called arkhandrus town it may be that there was another arkhandrus but the name is not egyptian
so far all i have said is the record of my own autopsy and judgment and inquiry henceforth i will record egyptian chronicles according to what i have heard adding something of what i myself have seen
the priests told me that min was the first king of egypt and that first he separated memphis from the nile by a dam all the river had flowed close under the sandy mountains on the libyan side but min made the southern bend of it which begins about twelve and one half miles above memphis by damming the stream thereby drying up the ancient channel and carried the river by a channel so that it flowed midway between the hills
and to this day the persians keep careful watch on this bend of the river strengthening its dam every year to keep the current in for were the nile to burst its dikes and overflow here all memphis would be in danger of flooding
then when this first king min had made dry land of what he thus cut off he first founded in it that city which is now called memphis for even memphis lies in the narrow part of egypt and outside of it he dug a lake from the river to its north and west for the nile itself bounds it on the east and secondly he built in it the great and most noteworthy temple of hephaestus
after him came three hundred and thirty kings whose names the priests recited from a papyrus roll in all these many generations there were eighteen ethiopian kings and one queen native to the country the rest were all egyptian men
the name of the queen was the same as that of the babylonian princess nitocris she to avenge her brother he was king of egypt and was slain by his subjects who then gave nitocris the sovereignty put many of the egyptians to death by treachery
she built a spacious underground chamber then with the pretence of inaugurating it but with quite another intent in her mind she gave a great feast inviting to it those egyptians whom she knew to have had the most complicity in her brothers murder and while they feasted she let the river in upon them by a vast secret channel
this was all that the priests told of her except that when she had done this she cast herself into a chamber full of hot ashes to escape vengeance
but of the other kings they related no achievement or act of great note except of moeris the last of them
this moeris was remembered as having built the northern forecourt of the temple of hephaestus and dug a lake of as great a circumference as i shall later indicate and built pyramids there also the size of which i will mention when i speak of the lake all this was moeris work they said of none of the rest had they anything to record
leaving the latter aside then i shall speak of the king who came after them whose name was sesostris
this king the priests said set out with a fleet of long ships from the arabian gulf and subjugated all those living by the red sea until he came to a sea which was too shallow for his vessels
after returning from there back to egypt he gathered a great army according to the account of the priests and marched over the mainland subjugating every nation to which he came
when those that he met were valiant men and strove hard for freedom he set up pillars in their land the inscription on which showed his own name and his countrys and how he had overcome them with his own power
but when the cities had made no resistance and been easily taken then he put an inscription on the pillars just as he had done where the nations were brave but he also drew on them the private parts of a woman wishing to show clearly that the people were cowardly
he marched over the country doing this until he had crossed over from asia to europe and defeated the scythians and thracians thus far and no farther i think the egyptian army went for the pillars can be seen standing in their country but in none beyond it
from there he turned around and went back home and when he came to the phasis river that king sesostris may have detached some part of his army and left it there to live in the country for i cannot speak with exact knowledge or it may be that some of his soldiers grew weary of his wanderings and stayed by the phasis
for it is plain to see that the colchians are egyptians and what i say i myself noted before i heard it from others when it occurred to me i inquired of both peoples and the colchians remembered the egyptians better than the egyptians remembered the colchians
the egyptians said that they considered the colchians part of sesostris army i myself guessed it partly because they are darkskinned and woollyhaired though that indeed counts for nothing since other peoples are too but my better proof was that the colchians and egyptians and ethiopians are the only nations that have from the first practised circumcision
the phoenicians and the syrians of palestine acknowledge that they learned the custom from the egyptians and the syrians of the valleys of the thermodon and the parthenius as well as their neighbors the macrones say that they learned it lately from the colchians these are the only nations that circumcise and it is seen that they do just as the egyptians
but as to the egyptians and ethiopians themselves i cannot say which nation learned it from the other for it is evidently a very ancient custom that the others learned it through traffic with egypt i consider clearly proved by this that phoenicians who traffic with hellas cease to imitate the egyptians in this matter and do not circumcise their children
listen to something else about the colchians in which they are like the egyptians they and the egyptians alone work linen and have the same way of working it a way peculiar to themselves and they are alike in all their way of life and in their speech linen has two names the colchian kind is called by the greeks sardonian  that which comes from egypt is called egyptian
as to the pillars that sesostris king of egypt set up in the countries most of them are no longer to be seen but i myself saw them in the palestine district of syria with the aforesaid writing and the womens private parts on them
also there are in ionia two figures of this man carved in rock one on the road from ephesus to phocaea and the other on that from sardis to smyrna
in both places the figure is over twenty feet high with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left and the rest of his equipment proportional for it is both egyptian and ethiopian
and right across the breast from one shoulder to the other a text is cut in the egyptian sacred characters saying i myself won this land with the strength of my shoulders there is nothing here to show who he is and whence he comes but it is shown elsewhere
some of those who have seen these figures guess they are memnon but they are far indeed from the truth
now when this egyptian sesostris so the priests said reached daphnae of pelusium on his way home leading many captives from the peoples whose lands he had subjugated his brother whom he had left in charge in egypt invited him and his sons to a banquet and then piled wood around the house and set it on fire
when sesostris was aware of this he at once consulted his wife whom it was said he had with him and she advised him to lay two of his six sons on the fire and make a bridge over the burning so that they could walk over the bodies of the two and escape this sesostris did two of his sons were thus burnt but the rest escaped alive with their father
after returning to egypt and avenging himself on his brother sesostris found work for the multitude which he brought with him from the countries which he had subdued
it was these who dragged the great and long blocks of stone which were brought in this kings reign to the temple of hephaestus and it was they who were compelled to dig all the canals which are now in egypt and involuntarily made what had been a land of horses and carts empty of these
for from this time egypt although a level land could use no horses or carts because there were so many canals going every which way the reason why the king thus intersected the country was this
those egyptians whose towns were not on the nile but inland from it lacked water whenever the flood left their land and drank only brackish water from wells
for this reason egypt was intersected this king also they said divided the country among all the egyptians by giving each an equal parcel of land and made this his source of revenue assessing the payment of a yearly tax
and any man who was robbed by the river of part of his land could come to sesostris and declare what had happened then the king would send men to look into it and calculate the part by which the land was diminished so that thereafter it should pay in proportion to the tax originally imposed
from this in my opinion the greeks learned the art of measuring land the sunclock and the sundial and the twelve divisions of the day came to hellas from babylonia and not from egypt
sesostris was the only egyptian king who also ruled ethiopia to commemorate his name he set before the temple of hephaestus two stone statues of himself and of his wife each fifty feet high and statues of his four sons each thirtythree feet
long afterwards darius the persian would have set up his statue before these but the priest of hephaestus forbade him saying that he had achieved nothing equal to the deeds of sesostris the egyptian for sesostris he said had subjugated the scythians besides as many nations as darius had conquered and darius had not been able to overcome the scythians
therefore it was not just that darius should set his statue before the statues of sesostris whose achievements he had not equalled darius it is said let the priest have his way
when sesostris died he was succeeded in the kingship the priests said by his son pheros this king waged no wars and chanced to become blind for the following reason the nile came down in such a flood as there had never been rising to a height of thirty feet and the water that flowed over the fields was roughened by a strong wind
then it is said the king was so audacious as to seize a spear and hurl it into the midst of the river eddies right after this he came down with a disease of the eyes and became blind when he had been blind for ten years an oracle from the city of buto declared to him that the term of his punishment was drawing to an end and that he would regain his sight by washing his eyes with the urine of a woman who had never had intercourse with any man but her own husband
pheros tried his own wife first and as he remained blind all women one after another when he at last recovered his sight he took all the women whom he had tried except the one who had made him see again and gathered them into one town the one which is now called red clay having concentrated them together there he burnt them and the town
but the woman by whose means he had recovered his sight he married most worthy of mention among the many offerings which he dedicated in all the noteworthy temples for his deliverance from blindness are the two marvellous stone obelisks which he set up in the temple of the sun each of these is made of a single block and is over one hundred and sixtysix feet high and thirteen feet thick
pheros was succeeded they said by a man of memphis whose name in the greek tongue was proteus this proteus has a very attractive and wellappointed temple precinct at memphis south of the temple of hephaestus
around the precinct live phoenicians of tyre and the whole place is called the camp of the tyrians there is in the precinct of proteus a temple called the temple of the stranger aphrodite i guess this is a temple of helen daughter of tyndarus partly because i have heard the story of helens abiding with proteus and partly because it bears the name of the foreign aphrodite for no other of aphrodites temples is called by that name
when i inquired of the priests they told me that this was the story of helen after carrying off helen from sparta alexandrus sailed away for his own country violent winds caught him in the aegean and drove him into the egyptian sea and from there as the wind did not let up he came to egypt to the mouth of the nile called the canopic mouth and to the salters
now there was and still is on the coast a temple of heracles if a servant of any man takes refuge there and is branded with certain sacred marks delivering himself to the god he may not be touched this law continues today the same as it has always been from the first
hearing of the temple law some of alexandrus servants ran away from him threw themselves on the mercy of the god and brought an accusation against alexandrus meaning to injure him telling the whole story of helen and the wrong done menelaus they laid this accusation before the priests and the warden of the nile mouth whose name was thonis
when thonis heard it he sent this message the quickest way to proteus at memphis
a stranger has come a trojan who has committed an impiety in hellas after defrauding his guestfriend he has come bringing the mans wife and a very great deal of wealth driven to your country by the wind are we to let him sail away untouched or are we to take away what he has come with
proteus sent back this message whoever this is who has acted impiously against his guestfriend seize him and bring him to me that i may know what he will say
hearing this thonis seized alexandrus and detained his ships there and then brought him with helen and all the wealth and the suppliants too to memphis
when all had arrived proteus asked alexandrus who he was and whence he sailed alexandrus told him his lineage and the name of his country and about his voyage whence he sailed
then proteus asked him where he had got helen when alexandrus was evasive in his story and did not tell the truth the men who had taken refuge with the temple confuted him and related the whole story of the wrong
finally proteus declared the following judgment to them saying if i did not make it a point never to kill a stranger who has been caught by the wind and driven to my coasts i would have punished you on behalf of the greek you most vile man you committed the gravest impiety after you had had your guestfriends hospitality you had your guestfriends wife
and as if this were not enough you got her to fly with you and went off with her and not just with her either but you plundered your guestfriends wealth and brought it too
now then since i make it a point not to kill strangers i shall not let you take away this woman and the wealth but i shall watch them for the greek stranger until he come and take them away but as for you and your sailors i warn you to leave my country for another within three days and if you do not i will declare war on you
this the priests said was how helen came to proteus and in my opinion homer knew this story too but seeing that it was not so well suited to epic poetry as the tale of which he made use he rejected it showing that he knew it
this is apparent from the passage in the iliad and nowhere else does he return to the story where he relates the wanderings of alexander and shows how he and helen were carried off course and wandered to among other places sidon in phoenicia
this is in the story of the prowess of diomedes where the verses run as follows
there were the robes all embroidered
the work of women of sidon whom godlike alexandrus himself
brought from sidon crossing the broad sea
the same voyage on which he brought back helen of noble descent hom il
he mentions it in the odyssey alsothe daughter of zeus had such ingenious drugs
good ones which she had from thons wife polydamna an egyptian
whose countrys fertile plains bear the most drugs
many mixed for good many for harm hom od
and again menelaus says to telemachusi was eager to return here but the gods still held me in egypt
since i had not sacrificed entire hecatombs to them hom od
in these verses the poet shows that he knew of alexanders wanderings to egypt for syria borders on egypt and the phoenicians to whom sidon belongs dwell in syria
these verses and this passage prove most clearly that the cyprian poems are not the work of homer but of someone else for the cyprian poems relate that alexandrus reached ilion with helen in three days from sparta having a fair wind and a smooth sea but according to the iliad he wandered from his course in bringing her
enough then of homer and the cyprian poems but when i asked the priests whether the greek account of what happened at troy were idle or not they gave me the following answer saying that they had inquired and knew from menelaus himself
after the rape of helen a great force of greeks came to the trojan land on menelaus behalf after disembarking and disposing their forces they sent messengers to ilion one of whom was menelaus himself
when these were let inside the city walls they demanded the restitution of helen and of the property which alexandrus had stolen from menelaus and carried off and they demanded reparation for the wrongs but the trojans gave the same testimony then and later sworn and unsworn that they did not have helen or the property claimed but all of that was in egypt and they could not justly make reparation for what proteus the egyptian had
but the greeks thinking that the trojans were mocking them laid siege to the city until they took it but there was no helen there when they breached the wall but they heard the same account as before so crediting the original testimony they sent menelaus himself to proteus
menelaus then went to egypt and up the river to memphis there relating the truth of the matter he met with great hospitality and got back helen who had not been harmed and also all his wealth besides
yet although getting this menelaus was guilty of injustice toward the egyptians for adverse weather detained him when he tried to sail away after this continued for some time he carried out something impious
taking two native children and sacrificing them when it became known that he had done this he fled with his ships straight to libya hated and hunted and where he went from there the egyptians could not say the priests told me that they had learned some of this by inquiry but that they were sure of what had happened in their own country
the egyptians priests said this and i myself believe their story about helen for i reason thus had helen been in ilion then with or without the will of alexandrus she would have been given back to the greeks
for surely priam was not so mad or those nearest to him as to consent to risk their own persons and their children and their city so that alexandrus might cohabit with helen
even if it were conceded that they were so inclined in the first days yet when not only many of the trojans were slain in fighting against the greeks but priam himself lost to death two or three or even more of his sons in every battle if the poets are to be believed in this turn of events had helen been priams own wife i cannot but think that he would have restored her to the greeks if by so doing he could escape from the evils besetting him
alexandrus was not even heir to the throne in which case matters might have been in his hands since priam was old but hector who was an older and a better man than alexandrus was going to receive the royal power at priams death and ought not have acquiesced in his brothers wrongdoing especially when that brother was the cause of great calamity to hector himself and all the rest of the trojans
but since they did not have helen there to give back and since the greeks would not believe them although they spoke the truth i am convinced and declare the divine powers provided that the trojans perishing in utter destruction should make this clear to all mankind that retribution from the gods for terrible wrongdoing is also terrible this is what i think and i state it
the next to reign after proteus they said was rhampsinitus the memorial of his name left by him was the western forecourt of the temple of hephaestus he set two statues here fortyone feet high the northernmost of these the egyptians call summer and the southernmost winter the one that they call summer they worship and treat well but do the opposite to the statue called winter
this king they told me had great wealth in silver so great that none of the succeeding kings could surpass or come near it to store his treasure safely he had a stone chamber built one of its walls abutting on the outer side of his palace but the builder of it shrewdly provided that one stone be so placed as to be easily removed by two men or even by one
so when the chamber was finished the king stored his treasure in it and as time went on the builder drawing near the end of his life summoned his sons he had two and told them how he had provided for them that they have an ample livelihood by the art with which he had built the kings treasurehouse explaining clearly to them how to remove the stone he gave the coordinates of it and told them that if they kept these in mind they would be the custodians of the kings riches
so when he was dead his sons got to work at once coming to the palace by night they readily found and managed the stone in the building and took away much of the treasure
when the king opened the building he was amazed to see the containers lacking their treasure yet he did not know whom to accuse seeing that the seals were unbroken and the building shut fast but when less treasure appeared the second and third times he opened the building for the thieves did not stop plundering he had traps made and placed around the containers in which his riches were stored
the thieves came just as before and one of them crept in when he came near the container right away he was caught in the trap when he saw the trouble he was in he called to his brother right away and explained to him the problem and told him to come in quickly and cut off his head lest he be seen and recognized and destroy him too he seemed to have spoken rightly to the other who did as he was persuaded and then replacing the stone went home carrying his brothers head
when day came the king went to the building and was amazed to see in the trap the thiefs body without a head yet the building intact with no way in or out at a loss he did as follows he suspended the thiefs body from the wall and set guards over it instructing them to seize and bring to him any whom they saw weeping or making lamentation
but the thiefs mother when the body had been hung up was terribly stricken she had words with her surviving son and told him that he was somehow to think of some way to cut loose and bring her his brothers body and if he did not obey she threatened to go to the king and denounce him as having the treasure
so when his mother bitterly reproached the surviving son and for all that he said he could not dissuade her he devised a plan he harnessed asses and put skins full of wine on the asses then set out driving them and when he was near those who were guarding the hanging body he pulled at the feet of two or three of the skins and loosed their fastenings
and as the wine ran out he beat his head and cried aloud like one who did not know to which ass he should turn first while the guards when they saw the wine flowing freely ran out into the road with cups and caught what was pouring out thinking themselves in luck
feigning anger the man cursed all but as the guards addressed him peaceably he pretended to be soothed and to relent in his anger and finally drove his asses out of the road and put his harness in order
and after more words passed and one joked with him and got him to laugh he gave them one of the skins and they lay down there just as they were disposed to drink and included him and told him to stay and drink with them and he consented and stayed
when they cheerily saluted him in their drinking he gave them yet another of the skins and the guards grew very drunk with the abundance of liquor and lay down right there where they were drinking overpowered by sleep
but he when it was late at night cut down the body of his brother and shaved the right cheek of each of the guards for the indignity and loading the body on his asses drove home fulfilling his mothers commands
when the king learned that the body of the thief had been taken he was beside himself and obsessed with finding who it was who had managed this did as follows they say but i do not believe it
he put his own daughter in a brothel instructing her to accept all alike and before having intercourse to make each tell her the shrewdest and most impious thing he had done in his life whoever told her the story of the thief she was to seize and not let get out
the girl did as her father told her and the thief learning why she was doing this did as follows wanting to get the better of the king by craft
he cut the arm off a fresh corpse at the shoulder and went to the kings daughter carrying it under his cloak and when asked the same question as the rest he said that his most impious act had been when he had cut the head off his brother who was caught in a trap in the kings treasury and his shrewdest that after making the guards drunk he had cut down his brothers hanging body
when she heard this the princess grabbed for him but in the darkness the thief let her have the arm of the corpse and clutching it she held on believing that she had the arm of the other but the thief after giving it to her was gone in a flash out the door
when this also came to the kings ears he was astonished at the mans ingenuity and daring and in the end he sent a proclamation to every town promising the thief immunity and a great reward if he would come into the kings presence
the thief trusted the king and came before him rhampsinitus was very admiring and gave him his daughter to marry on the grounds that he was the cleverest of men for as the egyptians he said surpassed all others in craft so he surpassed the egyptians
they said that later this king went down alive to what the greeks call hades and there played dice with demeter and after winning some and losing some came back with a gift from her of a golden hand towel
from the descent of rhampsinitus when he came back they said that the egyptians celebrate a festival which i know that they celebrate to this day but whether this is why they celebrate i cannot say
on the day of the festival the priests weave a cloth and bind it as a headband on the eyes of one of their number whom they then lead wearing the cloth into a road that goes to the temple of demeter they themselves go back but this priest with his eyes bandaged is guided they say by two wolves to demeters temple a distance of three miles from the city and led back again from the temple by the wolves to the same place
these egyptian stories are for the benefit of whoever believes such tales my rule in this history is that i record what is said by all as i have heard it the egyptians say that demeter and dionysus are the rulers of the lower world
the egyptians were the first who maintained the following doctrine too that the human soul is immortal and at the death of the body enters into some other living thing then coming to birth and after passing through all creatures of land sea and air it enters once more into a human body at birth a cycle which it completes in three thousand years
there are greeks who have used this doctrine some earlier and some later as if it were their own i know their names but do not record them
they said that egypt until the time of king rhampsinitus was altogether wellgoverned and prospered greatly but that kheops who was the next king brought the people to utter misery for first he closed all the temples so that no one could sacrifice there and next he compelled all the egyptians to work for him
to some he assigned the task of dragging stones from the quarries in the arabian mountains to the nile and after the stones were ferried across the river in boats he organized others to receive and drag them to the mountains called libyan
they worked in gangs of a hundred thousand men each gang for three months for ten years the people wore themselves out building the road over which the stones were dragged work which was in my opinion not much lighter at all than the building of the pyramid
for the road is nearly a mile long and twenty yards wide and elevated at its highest to a height of sixteen yards and it is all of stone polished and carved with figures the aforesaid ten years went to the building of this road and of the underground chambers in the hill where the pyramids stand these the king meant to be burialplaces for himself and surrounded them with water bringing in a channel from the nile
the pyramid itself was twenty years in the making its base is square each side eight hundred feet long and its height is the same the whole is of stone polished and most exactly fitted there is no block of less than thirty feet in length
this pyramid was made like stairs which some call steps and others tiers
when this its first form was completed the workmen used short wooden logs as levers to raise the rest of the stones  they heaved up the blocks from the ground onto the first tier of steps
when the stone had been raised it was set on another lever that stood on the first tier and the lever again used to lift it from this tier to the next
it may be that there was a new lever on each tier of steps or perhaps there was only one lever quite portable which they carried up to each tier in turn i leave this uncertain as both possibilities were mentioned
but this is certain that the upper part of the pyramid was finished off first then the next below it and last of all the base and the lowest part
there are writings on the pyramid in egyptian characters indicating how much was spent on radishes and onions and garlic for the workmen and i am sure that when he read me the writing the interpreter said that sixteen hundred talents of silver had been paid
now if that is so how much must have been spent on the iron with which they worked and the workmens food and clothing considering that the time aforesaid was spent in building while hewing and carrying the stone and digging out the underground parts was as i suppose a business of long duration
and so evil a man was kheops that needing money he put his own daughter in a brothel and made her charge a fee how much they did not say she did as her father told her but was disposed to leave a memorial of her own and asked of each coming to her that he give one stone
and of these stones they said the pyramid was built that stands midmost of the three over against the great pyramid each side of it measures one hundred and fifty feet
the egyptians said that this kheops reigned for fifty years at his death he was succeeded by his brother khephren who was in all respects like kheops khephren also built a pyramid smaller than his brothers i have measured it myself
it has no underground chambers nor is it entered like the other by a canal from the nile but the river comes in through a built passage and encircles an island in which they say kheops himself lies
this pyramid was built on the same scale as the other except that it falls forty feet short of it in height it stands near the great pyramid the lowest layer of it is of variegated ethiopian stone both of them stand on the same ridge which is about a hundred feet high khephren they said reigned for fiftysix years
thus they reckon that for a hundred and six years egypt was in great misery and the temples so long shut were never opened the people hate the memory of these two kings so much that they do not much wish to name them and call the pyramids after the shepherd philitis who then pastured his flocks in this place
the next king of egypt they said was kheops son mycerinus disliking his fathers doings he opened the temples and let the people ground down to the depth of misery go to their business and their sacrifices and he was the most just judge among all the kings
this is why he is praised above all the rulers of egypt for not only were his judgments just but mycerinus would give any who were not satisfied with the judgment a present out of his own estate to compensate him for his loss
though mild toward his people and conducting himself as he did yet he suffered calamities the first of which was the death of his daughter the only child of his household deeply grieved over this misfortune he wanted to give her a burial somewhat more sumptuous than ordinary he therefore made a hollow cows image of gilded wood and placed the body of his dead daughter therein
this cow was not buried in the earth but was to be seen even in my time in the town of saïs where it stood in a furnished room of the palace incense of all kinds is offered daily before it and a lamp burns by it all through every night
near this cow in another chamber statues of mycerinus concubines stand so the priests of saïs said and in fact there are about twenty colossal wooden figures there made like naked women but except what i was told i cannot tell who these are
but some tell the following story about the cow and the statues that mycerinus conceived a passion for his own daughter and then had intercourse with her against her will
and they say that afterwards the girl strangled herself for grief and that he buried her in this cow but that her mother cut off the hands of the attendants who had betrayed the daughter to her father and that now their statues are in the same condition as the living women were
but this i believe to be a silly story especially about the hands of the figures for in fact we ourselves saw that the hands have fallen off through age and were lying at their feet even in my day
as for the cow it is covered with a purple robe only the head and neck exposed encrusted with a very thick layer of gold between the horns is the golden figure of the suns orb
it does not stand but kneels it is as big as a live cow of great size this image is carried out of the chamber once every year whenever the egyptians mourn the god whose name i omit in speaking of these matters
then the cow is brought out into the light for they say that before she died she asked her father mycerinus that she see the sun once a year
after what happened to his daughter the following happened next to this king an oracle came to him from the city of buto announcing that he had just six years to live and was to die in the seventh
the king took this badly and sent back to the oracle a message of reproach blaming the god that his father and his uncle though they had shut up the temples and disregarded the gods and destroyed men had lived for a long time but that he who was pious was going to die so soon
but a second oracle came announcing that for this very reason his life was hastening to a close he had done what was contrary to fate egypt should have been afflicted for a hundred and fifty years and the two kings before him knew this but not he
hearing this mycerinus knew that his doom was fixed therefore he had many lamps made and would light these at nightfall and drink and enjoy himself not letting up day or night roaming to the marsh country and the groves and wherever he heard of the likeliest places of pleasure
this was his recourse so that by turning night into day he might make his six years into twelve and so prove the oracle false
this king too left a pyramid but far smaller than his fathers each side twenty feet short of three hundred feet long square at the base and as much as half its height of ethiopian stone some greeks say that it was built by rhodopis the courtesan but they are wrong
indeed it is clear to me that they say this without even knowing who rhodopis was otherwise they would never have credited her with the building of a pyramid on which what i may call an uncountable sum of money was spent or that rhodopis flourished in the reign of amasis not of mycerinus
for very many years later than these kings who left the pyramids came rhodopis who was thracian by birth and a slave of iadmon son of hephaestopolis the samian and a fellowslave of aesop the storywriter for he was owned by iadmon too as the following made crystal clear
when the delphians obeying an oracle issued many proclamations summoning anyone who wanted it to accept compensation for the killing of aesop no one accepted it except the son of iadmons son another iadmon hence aesop too was iadmons
rhodopis came to egypt to work brought by xanthes of samos but upon her arrival was freed for a lot of money by kharaxus of mytilene son of scamandronymus and brother of sappho the poetess
thus rhodopis lived as a free woman in egypt where as she was very alluring she acquired a lot of money sufficient for such a rhodopis so to speak but not for such a pyramid
seeing that to this day anyone who likes can calculate what one tenth of her worth was she cannot be credited with great wealth for rhodopis desired to leave a memorial of herself in greece by having something made which no one else had thought of or dedicated in a temple and presenting this at delphi to preserve her memory
so she spent one tenth of her substance on the manufacture of a great number of iron beef spits as many as the tenth would pay for and sent them to delphi these lie in a heap to this day behind the altar set up by the chians and in front of the shrine itself
the courtesans of naucratis seem to be peculiarly alluring for the woman of whom this story is told became so famous that every greek knew the name of rhodopis and later on a certain archidice was the theme of song throughout greece although less celebrated than the other
kharaxus after giving rhodopis her freedom returned to mytilene he is bitterly attacked by sappho in one of her poems this is enough about rhodopis
after mycerinus the priests said asukhis became king of egypt he built the eastern outer court of hephaestus temple this is by far the finest and grandest of all the courts for while all have carved figures and innumerable felicities of architecture this court has far more than any
as not much money was in circulation during this kings reign they told me a law was made for the egyptians allowing a man to borrow on the security of his fathers corpse and the law also provided that the lender become master of the entire burialvault of the borrower and that the penalty for one giving this security should he fail to repay the loan was that he was not to be buried at his death either in that tomb of his fathers or in any other nor was he to bury any relative of his there
furthermore in his desire to excel all who ruled egypt before him this king left a pyramid of brick to commemorate his name on which is this writing cut on a stone
do not think me less than pyramids of stone for i excel them as much as zeus does other gods for they stuck a pole down into a marsh and collected what mud clung to the pole made bricks of it and thus built me these were the acts of asukhis
after him reigned a blind man called anysis of the town of that name in his reign egypt was invaded by sabacos king of ethiopia and a great army of ethiopians
the blind man fled to the marshes and the ethiopian ruled egypt for fifty years during which he distinguished himself for the following
he would never put to death any egyptian wrongdoer but sentenced all according to the severity of their offenses to raise embankments in their native towns thus the towns came to stand yet higher than before
for after first being built on embankments made by the excavators of the canals in the reign of sesostris they were yet further raised in the reign of the ethiopian
of the towns in egypt that were raised in my opinion bubastis is especially prominent where there is also a temple of bubastis a building most worthy of note other temples are greater and more costly but none more pleasing to the eye than this bubastis is in the greek language artemis
her temple is of this description except for the entrance it stands on an island for two channels approach it from the nile without mixing with one another running as far as the entryway of the temple the one and the other flowing around it each a hundred feet wide and shaded by trees
the outer court is sixty feet high adorned with notable figures ten feet high the whole circumference of the city commands a view down into the temple in its midst for the citys level has been raised but that of the temple has been left as it was from the first so that it can be seen into from above
a stone wall cut with figures runs around it within is a grove of very tall trees growing around a great shrine where the image of the goddess is the temple is a square each side measuring an eighth of a mile
a road paved with stone about three eighths of a mile long leads to the entrance running eastward through the marketplace towards the temple of hermes this road is about four hundred feet wide and bordered by trees reaching to heaven such is this temple
now the departure of the ethiopian they said came about in this way after seeing in a dream one who stood over him and urged him to gather together all the priests in egypt and cut them in half he fled from the country
seeing this vision he said he supposed it to be a manifestation sent to him by the gods so that he might commit sacrilege and so be punished by gods or men he would not he said do so but otherwise for the time foretold for his rule over egypt was now fulfilled after which he was to depart
for when he was still in ethiopia the oracles that are consulted by the people of that country told him that he was fated to reign fifty years over egypt seeing that this time was now completed and that he was troubled by what he saw in his dream sabacos departed from egypt of his own volition
when the ethiopian left egypt the blind man it is said was king once more returning from the marshes where he had lived for fifty years on an island that he built of ashes and earth for the egyptians who were to bring him food without the ethiopians knowledge were instructed by the king to bring ashes whenever they came to add to their gift
this island was never discovered before the time of amyrtaeus all the kings before him sought it in vain for more than seven hundred years the name of it is elbo and it is over a mile long and of an equal breadth
the next king was the priest of hephaestus whose name was sethos he despised and had no regard for the warrior egyptians thinking he would never need them besides otherwise dishonoring them he took away the chosen lands which had been given to them twelve fields to each man in the reign of former kings
so when presently king sanacharib came against egypt with a great force of arabians and assyrians the warrior egyptians would not march against him
the priest in this quandary went into the temple shrine and there before the gods image bitterly lamented over what he expected to suffer sleep came on him while he was lamenting and it seemed to him the god stood over him and told him to take heart that he would come to no harm encountering the power of arabia i shall send you champions said the god
so he trusted the vision and together with those egyptians who would follow him camped at pelusium where the road comes into egypt and none of the warriors would go with him but only merchants and craftsmen and traders
their enemies came there too and during the night were overrun by a horde of field mice that gnawed quivers and bows and the handles of shields with the result that many were killed fleeing unarmed the next day
and to this day a stone statue of the egyptian king stands in hephaestus temple with a mouse in his hand and an inscription to this effect look at me and believe
thus far went the record given by the egyptians and their priests and they showed me that the time from the first king to that priest of hephaestus who was the last covered three hundred and fortyone generations and that in this time this also had been the number of their kings and of their high priests
now three hundred generations are ten thousand years three generations being equal to a hundred and over and above the three hundred the remaining fortyone cover thirteen hundred and forty years
thus the whole period is eleven thousand three hundred and forty years in all of which time they said they had had no king who was a god in human form nor had there been any such either before or after those years among the rest of the kings of egypt
four times in this period so they told me the sun rose contrary to experience twice he came up where he now goes down and twice went down where he now comes up yet egypt at these times underwent no change either in the produce of the river and the land or in the matter of sickness and death
hecataeus the historian was once at thebes
where he made a genealogy for himself that had him descended from a god in the sixteenth generation but the priests of zeus did with him as they also did with me who had not traced my own lineage
they brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me wooden figures there which they counted to the total they had already given for every high priest sets up a statue of himself there during his lifetime
pointing to these and counting the priests showed me that each succeeded his father they went through the whole line of figures back to the earliest from that of the man who had most recently died
thus when hecataeus had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and fortyfive figures not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero but declaring each figure to be a piromis the son of a piromis in greek one who is in all respects a good man
thus they showed that all those whose statues stood there had been good men but quite unlike gods
before these men they said the rulers of egypt were gods but none had been contemporary with the human priests of these gods one or another had in succession been supreme the last of them to rule the country was osiris son horus whom the greeks call apollo he deposed typhon and was the last divine king of egypt osiris is in the greek language dionysus
among the greeks heracles dionysus and pan are held to be the youngest of the gods but in egypt pan is the most ancient of these and is one of the eight gods who are said to be the earliest of all heracles belongs to the second dynasty that of the socalled twelve gods and dionysus to the third which came after the twelve
how many years there were between heracles and the reign of amasis i have already shown pan is said to be earlier still the years between dionysus and amasis are the fewest and they are reckoned by the egyptians at fifteen thousand
the egyptians claim to be sure of all this since they have reckoned the years and chronicled them in writing
now the dionysus who was called the son of semele daughter of cadmus was about sixteen hundred years before my time and heracles son of alcmene about nine hundred years and pan the son of penelope for according to the greeks penelope and hermes were the parents of pan was about eight hundred years before me and thus of a later date than the trojan war
with regard to these two pan and dionysus one may follow whatever story one thinks most credible but i give my own opinion concerning them here had dionysus son of semele and pan son of penelope appeared in hellas and lived there to old age like heracles the son of amphitryon it might have been said that they too like heracles were but men named after the older pan and dionysus the gods of antiquity
but as it is the greek story has it that no sooner was dionysus born than zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to nysa in ethiopia beyond egypt and as for pan the greeks do not know what became of him after his birth it is therefore plain to me that the greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge
so far i have recorded what the egyptians themselves say i shall now relate what is recorded alike by egyptians and foreigners and shall add something of what i myself have seen
after the reign of the priest of hephaestus the egyptians were made free but they could never live without a king so they divided egypt into twelve districts and set up twelve kings
these kings intermarried and agreed to be close friends no one deposing another or seeking to possess more than another
the reason for this agreement which they scrupulously kept was this no sooner were they established in their districts than an oracle was given them that whichever of them poured a libation from a bronze vessel in the temple of hephaestus where as in all the temples they used to assemble would be king of all egypt
moreover they decided to preserve the memory of their names by a common memorial and so they made a labyrinth a little way beyond lake moeris and near the place called the city of crocodiles i have seen it myself and indeed words cannot describe it
if one were to collect the walls and evidence of other efforts of the greeks the sum would not amount to the labor and cost of this labyrinth and yet the temple at ephesus and the one on samos are noteworthy
though the pyramids beggar description and each one of them is a match for many great monuments built by greeks this maze surpasses even the pyramids
it has twelve roofed courts with doors facing each other six face north and six south in two continuous lines all within one outer wall there are also double sets of chambers three thousand altogether fifteen hundred above and the same number under ground
we ourselves viewed those that are above ground and speak of what we have seen but we learned through conversation about the underground chambers
the egyptian caretakers would by no means show them as they were they said the burial vaults of the kings who first built this labyrinth and of the sacred crocodiles
thus we can only speak from hearsay of the lower chambers the upper we saw for ourselves and they are creations greater than human the exits of the chambers and the mazy passages hither and thither through the courts were an unending marvel to us as we passed from court to apartment and from apartment to colonnade from colonnades again to more chambers and then into yet more courts
over all this is a roof made of stone like the walls and the walls are covered with cut figures and every court is set around with pillars of white stone very precisely fitted together near the corner where the labyrinth ends stands a pyramid two hundred and forty feet high on which great figures are cut a passage to this has been made underground
such is this labyrinth and still more marvellous is lake moeris on which it stands this lake has a circumference of four hundred and fifty miles or sixty schoeni as much as the whole seaboard of egypt its length is from north to south the deepest part has a depth of fifty fathoms
that it has been dug out and made by mens hands the lake shows for itself for almost in the middle of it stand two pyramids so built that fifty fathoms of each are below and fifty above the water atop each is a colossal stone figure seated on a throne
thus these pyramids are a hundred fathoms high and a hundred fathoms equal a furlong of six hundred feet the fathom measuring six feet or four cubits the foot four spans and the cubit six spans
the water of the lake is not natural for the country here is exceedingly arid but brought by a channel from the nile six months it flows into the lake and six back into the river
for the six months that it flows out of the lake the daily take of fish brings a silver talent into the royal treasury and twenty minae for each day of the flow into the lake
furthermore the natives said that this lake drains underground into the libyan syrtis and extends under the mountains that are above memphis having the inland country on its west
when i could not see anywhere the earth taken from the digging of this lake since this was curious to me i asked those who live nearest the lake where the stuff was that had been dug out they told me where it had been carried and i readily believed them for i had heard of a similar thing happening in the assyrian city of ninus
sardanapallus king of ninus had great wealth which he kept in an underground treasury some thieves plotted to carry it off they surveyed their course and dug an underground way from their own house to the palace carrying the earth taken out of the passage dug by night to the tigris which runs past ninus until at last they accomplished their end
this i was told had happened when the egyptian lake was dug except that the work went on not by night but by day the egyptians bore the earth dug out by them to the nile to be caught and scattered as was to be expected by the river thus is this lake said to have been dug
now the twelve kings were just and in time came to sacrifice in hephaestus temple on the last day of the feast as they were about to pour libations the high priest brought out the golden vessels which they commonly used for this but he counted wrongly and had only eleven for the twelve
so the last in line psammetichus as he had no vessel took off his bronze helmet and held it out and poured the libation with it all the kings were accustomed to wear helmets and were then helmeted
it was not in guile then that psammetichus held out his headgear but the rest perceived what psammetichus had done and remembered the oracle that promised the sovereignty of all egypt to whoever poured a libation from a vessel of bronze therefore though they considered psammetichus not deserving of death for they examined him and found that he had acted without intent they decided to strip him of most of his power and to chase him away into the marshes and that he was not to concern himself with the rest of egypt
this psammetichus had formerly been in exile in syria where he had fled from sabacos the ethiopian who killed his father necos then when the ethiopian departed because of what he saw in a dream the egyptians of the district of saïs brought him back from syria
psammetichus was king for the second time when he found himself driven away into the marshes by the eleven kings because of the helmet
believing therefore that he had been abused by them he meant to be avenged on those who had expelled him he sent to inquire in the town of buto where the most infallible oracle in egypt is the oracle answered that he would have vengeance when he saw men of bronze coming from the sea
psammetichus did not in the least believe that men of bronze would come to aid him but after a short time ionians and carians voyaging for plunder were forced to put in on the coast of egypt where they disembarked in their armor of bronze and an egyptian came into the marsh country and brought news to psammetichus for he had never before seen armored men that men of bronze had come from the sea and were foraging in the plain
psammetichus saw in this the fulfillment of the oracle he made friends with the ionians and carians and promised them great rewards if they would join him and having won them over deposed the eleven kings with these allies and those egyptians who volunteered
having made himself master of all egypt he made the southern outer court of hephaestus temple at memphis and built facing this a court for apis where apis is kept and fed whenever he appears this court has an inner colonnade all around it and many cut figures the roof is held up by great statues twenty feet high for pillars apis in greek is epaphus
to the ionians and carians who had helped him psammetichus gave places to live in called the camps opposite each other on either side of the nile and besides this he paid them all that he had promised
moreover he put egyptian boys in their hands to be taught greek and from these who learned the language are descended the presentday egyptian interpreters
the ionians and carians lived for a long time in these places which are near the sea on the arm of the nile called the pelusian a little way below the town of bubastis long afterwards king amasis removed them and settled them at memphis to be his guard against the egyptians
it is a result of our communication with these settlers in egypt the first of foreign speech to settle in that country that we greeks have exact knowledge of the history of egypt from the reign of psammetichus onwards
there still remained in my day in the places out of which the ionians and carians were turned the winches for their ships and the ruins of their houses this is how psammetichus got egypt
i have often mentioned the egyptian oracle and shall give an account of this as it deserves this oracle is sacred to leto and is situated in a great city by the sebennytic arm of the nile on the way up from the sea
buto is the name of the city where this oracle is i have already mentioned it in buto there is a temple of apollo and artemis the shrine of leto where the oracle is is itself very great and its outer court is sixty feet high
but what caused me the most wonder among the things apparent there i shall mention in this precinct is the shrine of leto the height and length of whose walls is all made of a single stone slab each wall has an equal length and height namely seventy feet another slab makes the surface of the roof the cornice of which is seven feet broad
thus then the shrine is the most marvellous of all the things that i saw in this temple but of things of second rank the most wondrous is the island called khemmis
this lies in a deep and wide lake near the temple at buto and the egyptians say that it floats i never saw it float or move at all and i thought it a marvellous tale that an island should truly float
however that may be there is a great shrine of apollo on it and three altars stand there many palm trees grow on the island and other trees too some yielding fruit and some not
this is the story that the egyptians tell to explain why the island moves that on this island that did not move before leto one of the eight gods who first came to be who was living at buto where this oracle of hers is taking charge of apollo from isis hid him for safety in this island which is now said to float when typhon came hunting through the world keen to find the son of osiris
apollo and artemis were they say children of dionysus and isis and leto was made their nurse and preserver in egyptian apollo is horus demeter isis artemis bubastis
it was from this legend and no other that aeschylus son of euphorion took a notion which is in no poet before him that artemis was the daughter of demeter for this reason the island was made to float so they say
psammetichus ruled egypt for fiftythree years twentynine of which he spent before azotus a great city in syria besieging it until he took it azotus held out against a siege longer than any city of which we know
psammetichus had a son necos who became king of egypt it was he who began building the canal into the red sea which was finished by darius the persian this is four days voyage in length and it was dug wide enough for two triremes to move in it rowed abreast
it is fed by the nile and is carried from a little above bubastis by the arabian town of patumus it issues into the red sea digging began in the part of the egyptian plain nearest to arabia the mountains that extend to memphis the mountains where the stone quarries are come close to this plain
the canal is led along the foothills of these mountains in a long reach from west to east passing then into a ravine it bears southward out of the hill country towards the arabian gulf
now the shortest and most direct passage from the northern to the southern or red sea is from the casian promontory the boundary between egypt and syria to the arabian gulf and this is a distance of one hundred and twenty five miles neither more nor less
this is the most direct route but the canal is far longer inasmuch as it is more crooked in necos reign a hundred and twenty thousand egyptians died digging it necos stopped work stayed by a prophetic utterance that he was toiling beforehand for the barbarian the egyptians call all men of other languages barbarians
necos then stopped work on the canal and engaged in preparations for war some of his ships of war were built on the northern sea and some in the arabian gulf by the red sea coast the winches for landing these can still be seen
he used these ships when needed and with his land army met and defeated the syrians at magdolus taking the great syrian city of cadytis after the battle
he sent to branchidae of miletus and dedicated there to apollo the garments in which he won these victories then he died after a reign of sixteen years and his son psammis reigned in his place
while this psammis was king of egypt he was visited by ambassadors from elis the eleans boasting that they had arranged the olympic games with all the justice and fairness in the world and claiming that even the egyptians although the wisest of all men could not do better
when the eleans came to egypt and announced why they had come psammis assembled the egyptians reputed to be wisest these assembled and learned all that the eleans were to do regarding the games after explaining this the eleans said that they had come to learn whether the egyptians could discover any juster way
the egyptians deliberated and then asked the eleans if their own citizens took part in the contests the eleans answered that they did all greeks from elis or elsewhere might contend
then the egyptians said that in establishing this rule they fell short of complete fairness for there is no way that you will not favor your own townsfolk in the contest and wrong the stranger if you wish in fact to make just rules and have come to egypt for that reason you should admit only strangers to the contest and not eleans such was the counsel of the egyptians to the eleans
psammis reigned over egypt for only six years he invaded ethiopia and immediately thereafter died and apries the son of psammis reigned in his place
he was more fortunate than any former king except his greatgrandfather psammetichus during his rule of twentyfive years during which he sent an army against sidon and fought at sea with the king of tyre
but when it was fated that evil should overtake him the cause of it was something that i will now deal with briefly and at greater length in the libyan part of this history
apries sent a great force against cyrene and suffered a great defeat the egyptians blamed him for this and rebelled against him for they thought that apries had knowingly sent his men to their doom so that after their perishing in this way he might be the more secure in his rule over the rest of the egyptians bitterly angered by this those who returned home and the friends of the slain openly revolted
hearing of this apries sent amasis to dissuade them when amasis came up with the egyptians he exhorted them to desist but as he spoke an egyptian came behind him and put a helmet on his head saying it was the token of royalty
and amasis showed that this was not displeasing to him for after being made king by the rebel egyptians he prepared to march against apries
when apries heard of it he sent against amasis an esteemed egyptian named patarbemis one of his own court instructing him to take the rebel alive and bring him into his presence when patarbemis came and summoned amasis amasis who was on horseback rose up and farted telling the messenger to take that back to apries
but when in spite of this patarbemis insisted that amasis obey the kings summons and go to him amasis answered that he had long been preparing to do just that and apries would find him above reproach for he would present himself and bring others
hearing this patarbemis could not mistake amasis he saw his preparations and hastened to depart the more quickly to make known to the king what was going on when apries saw him return without amasis he did not stop to reflect but in his rage and fury had patarbemis ears and nose cut off
the rest of the egyptians who were until now apries friends seeing this outrage done to the man who was most prominent among them changed sides without delay and offered themselves to amasis
learning of this too apries armed his guard and marched against the egyptians he had a bodyguard of carians and ionians thirty thousand of them and his royal palace was in the city of saïs a great and marvellous palace
apries men marched against the egyptians and so did amasis men against the foreigners so they both came to momemphis and were going to make trial of one another
the egyptians are divided into seven classes priests warriors cowherds swineherds merchants interpreters and pilots there are this many classes each named after its occupation
the warriors are divided into kalasiries and hermotubies and they belong to the following districts for all divisions in egypt are made according to districts
the hermotubies are from the districts of busiris saïs khemmis and papremis the island called prosopitis and half of natho from all of these their number at its greatest attained to a hundred and sixty thousand none of these has learned any common trade they are free to follow the profession of arms alone
the kalasiries are from the districts of thebes
bubastis aphthis tanis mendes sebennys athribis pharbaïthis thmuis onuphis anytis myecphoris this last is in an island opposite the city of bubastis）
from all of these their number at its greatest attained to two hundred and fifty thousand men these too may practise no trade but war which is their hereditary calling
now whether this too the greeks have learned from the egyptians i cannot confidently judge i know that in thrace and scythia and persia and lydia and nearly all foreign countries those who learn trades are held in less esteem than the rest of the people and those who have least to do with artisans work especially men who are free to practise the art of war are highly honored
this much is certain that this opinion which is held by all greeks and particularly by the lacedaemonians is of foreign origin it is in corinth that artisans are held in least contempt
the warriors were the only egyptians except the priests who had special privileges for each of them an untaxed plot of twelve acres was set apart this acre is a square of a hundred egyptian cubits each way the egyptian cubit being equal to the samian
these lands were set apart for all it was never the same men who cultivated them but each in turn a thousand kalasiries and as many hermotubies were the kings annual bodyguard these men besides their lands each received a daily provision of five minaes weight of roast grain two minae of beef and four cups of wine these were the gifts received by each bodyguard
when apries with his guards and amasis with the whole force of egyptians came to the town of momemphis they engaged and though the foreigners fought well they were vastly outnumbered and therefore were beaten
apries they say supposed that not even a god could depose him from his throne so firmly did he think he was established and now defeated in battle and taken captive he was brought to saïs to the royal dwelling which belonged to him once but now belonged to amasis
there he was kept alive for a while in the palace and well treated by amasis but presently the egyptians complained that there was no justice in keeping alive one who was their own and their kings bitterest enemy whereupon amasis gave apries up to them and they strangled him and then buried him in the burialplace of his fathers
this is in the temple of athena very near to the sanctuary on the left of the entrance the people of saïs buried within the temple precinct all kings who were natives of their district
the tomb of amasis is farther from the sanctuary than the tomb of apries and his ancestors yet it too is within the temple court it is a great colonnade of stone richly adorned the pillars made in the form of palm trees in this colonnade are two portals and the place where the coffin lies is within their doors
there is also at saïs the burialplace of one whose name i think it impious to mention in speaking of such a matter it is in the temple of athena behind and close to the length of the wall of the shrine
moreover great stone obelisks stand in the precinct and there is a lake nearby adorned with a stone margin and made in a complete circle it is as it seemed to me the size of the lake at delos which they call the round pond
on this lake they enact by night the story of the gods sufferings a rite which the egyptians call the mysteries i could say more about this for i know the truth but let me preserve a discreet silence
let me preserve a discreet silence too concerning that rite of demeter which the greeks call thesmophoria  except as much of it as i am not forbidden to mention
the daughters of danaus were those who brought this rite out of egypt and taught it to the pelasgian women afterwards when the people of the peloponnese were driven out by the dorians it was lost except in so far as it was preserved by the arcadians the peloponnesian people which was not driven out but left in its home
after apries was deposed amasis became king he was from a town called siuph in the district of saïs
now at first he was scorned and held in low regard by the egyptians on the ground that he was a common man and of no high family but presently he won them over by being shrewd and not arrogant
he had among his countless treasures a golden washbowl in which he and all those who ate with him were accustomed to clean their feet this he broke in pieces and out of it made a gods image which he set in a most conspicuous spot in the city and the egyptians came frequently to this image and held it in great reverence
when amasis learned what the townsfolk were doing he called the egyptians together and told them that the image had been made out of the washbowl in which egyptians had once vomited and urinated and cleaned their feet but which now they greatly revered
now then he said i have fared like the washbowl since if before i was a common man still i am your king now and he told them to honor and show respect for him
the following was how he scheduled his affairs in the morning until the the hour when the marketplace filled he readily conducted whatever business was brought to him the rest of the day he drank and joked at the expense of his companions and was idle and playful
but this displeased his friends who admonished him thus o king you do not conduct yourself well by indulging too much in vulgarity you a celebrated man ought to conduct your business throughout the day sitting on a celebrated throne and thus the egyptians would know that they are governed by a great man and you would be better spoken of as it is what you do is by no means kingly
but he answered them like this men that have bows string them when they must use them and unstring them when they have used them were bows kept strung forever they would break and so could not be used when needed
such too is the nature of man were one to be always at serious work and not permit oneself a bit of relaxation he would go mad or idiotic before he knew it i am well aware of that and give each of the two its turn such was his answer to his friends
it is said that even when amasis was a private man he was fond of drinking and joking and was not at all a sober man and that when his drinking and pleasureseeking cost him the bare necessities he would go around stealing then when he contradicted those who said that he had their possessions they would bring him to whatever place of divination was nearby and sometimes the oracles declared him guilty and sometimes they acquitted him
when he became king he did not take care of the shrines of the gods who had acquitted him of theft or give them anything for maintenance or make it his practice to sacrifice there for he knew them to be worthless and their oracles false but he took scrupulous care of the gods who had declared his guilt considering them to be gods in very deed and their oracles infallible
amasis made a marvellous outer court for the temple of athena at saïs far surpassing all in its height and size and in the size and quality of the stone blocks moreover he set up huge images and vast manheaded sphinxes and brought enormous blocks of stone besides for the building
some of these he brought from the stone quarries of memphis the largest came from the city of elephantine twenty days journey distant by river from saïs
but what i admire most of his works is this he brought from elephantine a shrine made of one single block of stone its transport took three years and two thousand men had the carriage of it all of them pilots this chamber is thirtyfive feet long twentythree feet wide thirteen feet high
these are the external dimensions of the chamber which is made of one block its internal dimensions are thirtyone feet long twenty feet wide eight feet high it stands at the entrance of the temple
it was not dragged within so they say because while it was being drawn the chief builder complained aloud of the great expense of time and his loathing of the work and amasis taking this to heart would not let it be drawn further some also say that a man one of those who heaved up the shrine was crushed by it and therefore it was not dragged within
furthermore amasis dedicated besides monuments of marvellous size in all the other temples of note the huge image that lies supine before hephaestus temple at memphis this image is seventyfive feet in length there stand on the same base on either side of the great image two huge statues hewn from the same block each of them twenty feet high
there is at saïs another stone figure of like size supine as is the figure at memphis it was amasis too who built the great and most marvellous temple of isis at memphis
it is said that in the reign of amasis egypt attained to its greatest prosperity in respect of what the river did for the land and the land for its people and that the number of inhabited cities in the country was twenty thousand
it was amasis also who made the law that every egyptian declare his means of livelihood to the ruler of his district annually and that omitting to do so or to prove that one had a legitimate livelihood be punishable with death solon the athenian got this law from egypt and established it among his people may they always have it for it is a perfect law
amasis became a philhellene and besides other services which he did for some of the greeks he gave those who came to egypt the city of naucratis to live in and to those who travelled to the country without wanting to settle there he gave lands where they might set up altars and make holy places for their gods
of these the greatest and most famous and most visited precinct is that which is called the hellenion founded jointly by the ionian cities of chios teos phocaea and clazomenae the dorian cities of rhodes cnidus halicarnassus and phaselis and one aeolian city mytilene
it is to these that the precinct belongs and these are the cities that furnish overseers of the trading port if any other cities advance claims they claim what does not belong to them the aeginetans made a precinct of their own sacred to zeus and so did the samians for hera and the milesians for apollo
naucratis was in the past the only trading port in egypt whoever came to any other mouth of the nile had to swear that he had not come intentionally and had then to take his ship and sail to the canobic mouth or if he could not sail against contrary winds he had to carry his cargo in barges around the delta until he came to naucratis in such esteem was naucratis held
when the amphictyons paid three hundred talents to have the temple that now stands at delphi finished as that which was formerly there burnt down by accident it was the delphians lot to pay a fourth of the cost
they went about from city to city collecting gifts and got most from egypt for amasis gave them a thousand talents weight of astringent earth and the greek settlers in egypt twenty minae
amasis made friends and allies of the people of cyrene and he decided to marry from there either because he had his heart set on a greek wife or for the sake of the corcyreans friendship
in any case he married a certain ladice said by some to be the daughter of battus of arcesilaus by others and by others again of critobulus an esteemed citizen of the place but whenever amasis lay with her he became unable to have intercourse though he managed with every other woman
and when this happened repeatedly amasis said to the woman called ladice woman you have cast a spell on me and there is no way that you shall avoid perishing the most wretchedly of all women
so ladice when the king did not relent at all although she denied it vowed in her heart to aphrodite that if amasis could have intercourse with her that night since that would remedy the problem she would send a statue to cyrene to her and after the prayer immediately amasis did have intercourse with her and whenever amasis came to her thereafter he had intercourse and he was very fond of her after this
ladice paid her vow to the goddess she had an image made and sent it to cyrene where it stood safe until my time facing outside the city cambyses when he had conquered egypt and learned who ladice was sent her away to cyrene unharmed
moreover amasis dedicated offerings in hellas he gave to cyrene a gilt image of athena and a painted picture of himself to athena of lindus two stone images and a marvellous linen breastplate and to hera in samos two wooden statues of himself that were still standing in my time behind the doors in the great shrine
the offerings in samos were dedicated because of the friendship between amasis and polycrates son of aeaces what he gave to lindus was not out of friendship for anyone but because the temple of athena in lindus is said to have been founded by the daughters of danaus when they landed there in their flight from the sons of egyptus such were amasis offerings moreover he was the first conqueror of cyprus which he made tributary to himself
this was the end of aristagoras after he had brought about the ionian revolt histiaeus the tyrant of miletus arrived in sardis after he was let go by darius when he came there from susa artaphrenes the governor of sardis asked him for what reason he supposed the ionians had rebelled histiaeus said that he did not know and marvelled at what had happened pretending to have no knowledge of the present troubles
but artaphrenes saw that he dissembled and knowing the exact story of the revolt said i will tell you histiaeus the truth of this business it was you who stitched this shoe and aristagoras who put it on
thus spoke artaphrenes regarding the revolt histiaeus was frightened by artaphrenes understanding of the matter and fled the next night to the sea for he had deceived darius by promising to subdue sardo the greatest of the islands while secretly intending to make himself leader of the ionians in their war against darius
crossing over to chios he was taken and bound by the chians because they judged him to have been sent by darius to make trouble for them but when they learned the whole story of his hostility to the king they set him free
then histiaeus was asked by the ionians why he had so zealously ordered aristagoras to revolt from the king and done the ionians such great harm he did not at all reveal the true reason to them telling them instead that king darius had planned to remove the phoenicians and settle them in ionia and the ionians in phoenicia for this reason he said he had sent the order the king had made no such plan but histiaeus wanted to frighten the ionians
then histiaeus using hermippus a man of atarneus as messenger sent letters to the persians at sardis because they had previously talked with him about revolt but hermippus did not give the letters to the men to whom he was sent and went and delivered them to artaphrenes instead
artaphrenes learning all that was afoot bade hermippus carry histiaeus letters to those for whom he was bringing them and give him those which the persians sent in answer to histiaeus thus these men became known and then artaphrenes put many persians to death
so troubles arose in sardis since he failed in this hope the chians brought histiaeus back to miletus at his own request but the milesians were glad enough to be rid of aristagoras himself and they had no wish to receive another tyrant into their country now that they had tasted freedom
when histiaeus tried to force his way into miletus by night he was wounded in the thigh by a milesian since he was thrust out from his own city he went back to chios when he could not persuade the chians to give him ships he then crossed over to mytilene and persuaded the lesbians to give him ships
they manned eight triremes and sailed with histiaeus to byzantium there they encamped and seized all the ships that were sailing out of the euxine except when the crews consented to serve histiaeus
such were the doings of histiaeus and the mytilenaeans against miletus itself a great fleet and army were expected for the persian generals had joined their power together and made one army which they led against miletus taking less account of the other fortresses of the fleet the phoenicians were the most eager to fight and there came with them to the war the newly subdued cyprians and the cilicians and egyptians
these were coming to attack miletus and the rest of ionia when the ionians learned of it they sent deputies to take counsel for them in the panionium  when they came to that place and consulted they resolved not to collect a land army to meet the persians but to leave the milesians to defend their walls themselves and to man their fleet to the last ship and gather as quickly as possible at lade to fight for miletus at sea this lade is a small island lying off the city of miletus
the ionians then came there with their ships manned and with them the aeolians who dwell in lesbos this was their order of battle the milesians themselves had the eastern wing bringing eighty ships next to them were the prieneans with twelve ships and the myesians with three next to the myesians were the teians with seventeen ships next to these the chians with a hundred near these in the line were the erythraeans bringing eight ships and the phocaeans with three and next to these the lesbians with seventy last of all in the line were the samians holding the western wing with sixty ships
the total number of all these together was three hundred and fiftythree triremes
these were the ionian ships the ships of the foreigners were six hundred when these too reached the milesian shore and all their land power was present the persian generals learning the number of the ionian ships feared they would be too weak to overcome the greeks if they did not have mastery of the sea they would not be able to take miletus and would be in danger of some evil treatment by darius
with this in mind they gathered the tyrants of the ionians who had been deposed from their governments by aristagoras of miletus and had fled to the medes and who now were with the army that was led against miletus they gathered as many of these men as were with them and said to them
men of ionia let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the kings house let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power  set this promise before them they will suffer no harm for their rebellion neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before
but if they will not do so and are set on fighting then utter a threat that will restrain them if they are defeated in battle they will be enslaved we will make eunuchs of their boys and carry their maidens captive to bactra and hand over their land to others
so they spoke the ionian tyrants sent their messages by night each to his own countrymen but the ionians to whom these messages came were stubborn and would have no part of the treachery each thinking that the persians made this offer to them alone this happened immediately after the persians arrived at miletus
then the ionians who had gathered at lade held assemblies among those whom i suppose to have addressed them was dionysius the phocaean general who spoke thus
our affairs men of ionia stand on the edge of a razor whether to be free men or slaves and runaway slaves at that if you now consent to endure hardships you will have toil for the present time but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom but if you will be weak and disorderly i see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion
believe me and entrust yourselves to me i promise you that if the gods deal fairly with us either our enemies shall not meet us in battle or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished
when the ionians heard this they put themselves in dionysius hands he then each day put out to sea with ships in column using the rowers to pierce each others line of ships and arming the fighting men on board for the rest of the day he kept the fleet at anchor all day he made the ionians work
for seven days they obeyed him and did his bidding but on the next day untried as they were in such labor and worn out by hard work and by the sun the ionians began to say each to other
against what god have we sinned that we have to fulfill this task we have lost our minds and launched out into folly committing ourselves into the hands of this phocaean braggart who brings but three ships and having got us he afflicts us with afflictions incurable many of us have fallen sick already and many are likely to suffer the same thing instead of these ills it would be better for us to suffer anything and endure this coming slavery whatever it will be rather than be oppressed by that which is now upon us come let us obey him no longer
so they spoke and from then on no man would obey as if they were an army they raised tents on the island where they stayed in the shade and they were unwilling to embark upon their ships or to continue their exercises
when the generals of the samians learned what the ionians were doing they recalled that message which aeaces son of syloson had already sent them at the persians bidding entreating them to desert the ionian alliance seeing great disorder on the ionian side they consented to the message moreover it seemed impossible to them to overcome the kings power and they were well assured that if they overcame darius present fleet another one five times as large would come
therefore as soon as they saw the ionians refusing to be useful they took up that for a pretext considering it advantageous to save their own temples and houses this aeaces from whom they received the message was the son of syloson son of aeaces and had been tyrant of samos until he was deposed from his rule by aristagoras of miletus just like the other ionian tyrants
now when the phoenician fleet came sailing against them the ionians put out to sea against them with their ships in column when they drew near and met each other in battle which of the ionians were brave men or cowards then in that seafight i cannot exactly say for they all blame each other
the samians are said according to their agreement with aeaces to have raised their sails and gone off to samos leaving their post all except eleven ships
the captains of these stood their ground and fought disobeying their admirals for this deed the samian people granted that their names and patronymics should be engraved on a pillar as brave men this pillar now stands in their marketplace but the lesbians seeing their neighbors fleeing did the same as the samians and most of the ionians did likewise
the most roughly handled of those that stood their ground in the seafight were the chians since they refused to be cowards and achieved deeds of renown they brought a hundred ships to the fleet as was mentioned above and on each ship were forty picked men of their citizens
seeing themselves betrayed by the greater part of their allies they did not think it right to act like the worst among them with only a few allies to aid them they fought on and broke the enemys line until they had taken many ships but lost most of their own
the chians escaped to their own country with their remaining ships but the crews of the chian ships that were damaged and disabled were pursued and took refuge in mykale there the men beached and left their ships and made their way across the mainland
but when the chians entered the lands of ephesus on their march they came by night while the women were celebrating the thesmophoria then the ephesians never having heard the story of the chians and seeing an army invading their country were fully persuaded that these were robbers come after their women so they mustered all their force and killed the chians
so these men met with such a fate as for dionysius the phocaean when he saw that the ionian cause was lost he sailed away with the three enemy ships that he had captured but not to phocaea now that he knew well that it would be enslaved with the rest of ionia he right away sailed straight to phoenicia instead sunk some merchant ships took a lot of money and sailed to sicily from this base he set himself up as a pirate robbing carthaginians and tyrrhenians but no greeks
when the persians had conquered the ionians by sea they laid siege to miletus by sea and land mining the walls and using every device against it until they utterly captured it in the sixth year after the revolt of aristagoras they enslaved the city and thus the calamity agreed with the oracle concerning miletus
when the argives inquired at delphi about the safety of their city a common response was given one part regarding the argives themselves but there was an additional response for the milesians
i will mention the part concerning the argives when i come to that part of my history this was the prophecy given to the milesians in their absence
then miletus contriver of evil deeds
for many will you become a banquet and glorious gifts
your wives will wash the feet of many longhaired men
other ministers will tend my didyman shrine
all this now came upon the milesians since most of their men were slain by the persians who wore long hair and their women and children were accounted as slaves and the temple at didyma with its shrine and place of divination was plundered and burnt of the wealth that was in this temple i have often spoken elsewhere in my history
after that the captive milesians were brought to susa king darius did them no further harm settling them by the sea called red in the city of ampe by which the river tigris flows as it issues into the sea of the milesian land the persians themselves held what was nearest to the city and the plain giving the hill country into the possession of carians from pedasa
now when the milesians suffered all this at the hands of the persians the sybarites who had lost their city and dwelt in laus and scidrus did not give them equal return for what they had done when sybaris was taken by the crotoniates all the people of miletus young and old shaved their heads and made great public lamentation no cities which we know were ever so closely joined in friendship as these
the athenians acted very differently the athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of miletus in many ways but especially in this when phrynichus wrote a play entitled the fall of miletus and produced it the whole theater fell to weeping they fined phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever
miletus then was left empty of milesians the men of property among the samians were displeased by the dealings of their generals with the medes so after the seafight they took counsel immediately and resolved that before aeaces the tyrant came to their country they would sail to a colony rather than remain and be slaves of the medes and aeaces
the people of zancle in sicily about this time sent messengers to ionia inviting the ionians to the fair coast desiring there to found an ionian city this fair coast as it is called is in sicily in that part which looks towards tyrrhenia at this invitation the samians alone of the ionians with those milesians who had escaped set forth
in their journey a thing happened to them such as i will show as they voyaged to sicily the samians came to the country of the epizephyrian locrians at a time when the people of zancle and their king whose name was scythes were besieging a sicilian town desiring to take it
learning this anaxilaus the tyrant of rhegium being then in a feud with the zanclaeans joined forces with the samians and persuaded them to leave off their voyage to the fair coast and seize zancle while it was deserted by its men
the samians consented and seized zancle when they learned that their city was taken the zanclaeans came to deliver it calling to their aid hippocrates the tyrant of gela who was their ally
but hippocrates when he came bringing his army to aid them put scythes the monarch of zancle and his brother pythogenes in chains for losing the city and sent them away to the city of inyx he betrayed the rest of the zanclaeans to the samians with whom he had made an agreement and exchanged oaths
the price which the samians agreed to give him was that hippocrates should take for his share half of the movable goods and slaves in the city and all that was in the country
most of the zanclaeans were kept in chains as slaves by hippocrates himself he gave three hundred chief men to the samians to be put to death but the samians did not do so
scythes the monarch of zancle escaped from inyx to himera and from there he came to asia and went up country to king darius darius considered him the most honest man of all who had come up to him from hellas
for he returned by the kings permission to sicily and from sicily back again to darius until in old age he ended his life in persia in great wealth without trouble the samians planted themselves in that most excellent city of zancle after they had escaped from the medes
after the fight at sea for miletus the phoenicians at the persians bidding brought aeaces son of syloson back to samos for the high worth of his service to them and for his great achievements because of the desertion of their ships in the seafight the samians were the only rebel people whose city and temples were not burnt
after miletus was captured the persians at once gained possession of caria some of the towns submitted voluntarily others were brought over by force
all this happened so histiaeus the milesian was at byzantium seizing the ionian merchant ships as they sailed out of the euxine when he had news of the business of miletus leaving all matters concerning the hellespont in charge of bisaltes of abydos son of apollophanes he himself sailed with the lesbians to chios and when the chian guardships would not receive him fought in the hollows of chios as they are called
many of their crews he killed the rest of the people of the country since they were crippled by the seafight were mastered by histiaeus with his lesbians setting out from polichne in chios
it is common for some sign to be given when great ills threaten cities or nations for before all this plain signs had been sent to the chians
of a band of a hundred youths whom they had sent to delphi only two returned ninetyeight being caught and carried off by pestilence moreover at about this same time a little before the seafight the roof fell in on boys learning their letters of one hundred and twenty of them one alone escaped
these signs a god showed to them then the seafight broke upon them and beat the city to its knees on top of the seafight came histiaeus and the lesbians since the chians were in such a bad state he easily subdued them
then histiaeus brought a great force of ionians and aeolians against thasos while he was besieging thasos a message came that the phoenicians were putting out to sea from miletus to attack the rest of ionia when he learned this he left thasos unsacked and hastened instead with all his army to lesbos
from there since his army suffered from hunger he crossed over to reap from atarneus the corn there and the mysian corn of the caicus plain now it chanced that in that region was harpagus a persian with no small force under him when histiaeus landed harpagus met him in battle and took histiaeus himself alive and killed most of his army
histiaeus was taken prisoner in this way the greeks fought with the persians at malene in the country of atarneus the armies fought for a long time until the persian cavalry charged and fell upon the greeks so this was the accomplishment of the cavalry when the greeks were routed histiaeus supposing that the king would not put him to death for his present transgression did what showed that he loved his life too well
he was overtaken in his flight by a persian and when he was caught and about to be stabbed he cried out in the persian language and revealed himself to be histiaeus the milesian
now if he had been taken prisoner and brought to king darius he would have suffered no harm to my thinking and the king would have forgiven his guilt but as it was when histiaeus was brought to sardis both because of what he had done and for fear that he might escape and again win power at the court artaphrenes governor of sardis and harpagus who had captured him impaled his body on the spot and sent his head embalmed to king darius at susa
when darius learned of this he blamed those who had done it because they had not brought histiaeus before him alive and he commanded that the head should be washed and buried with due ceremony as of a man who had done great good to darius himself and to persia
thus it fared with histiaeus the persian fleet wintered at miletus and putting out to sea in the next year easily subdued the islands that lie off the mainland chios and lesbos and tenedos whenever they took an island the foreigners would net the people
this is the manner of their doing it the men link hands and make a line reaching from the northern sea to the southern and then advance over the whole island hunting the people down they also captured the ionian cities of the mainland in the same way but not by netting the people for that was not possible
then the persian generals were not false to the threats they had made against the ionians when they were encamped opposite them when they had gained mastery over the cities they chose out the most handsome boys and castrated them making them eunuchs instead of men and they carried the fairest maidens away to the king they did all this and they burnt the cities with their temples thus three times had the ionians been enslaved first by the lydians and now twice in a row by the persians
then the fleet departed from ionia and captured everything which lies to the left of one sailing up the hellespont the right side had been subdued by the persians themselves from the mainland these are the regions of europe that belong to the hellespont the chersonese in which there are many cities perinthus and the forts that lie towards thrace and selymbria and byzantium
the byzantines and the calchedonians beyond them did not even wait for the attack of the phoenicians but left their own land and fled away into the euxine and there settled in the city of mesambria the phoenicians burnt the aforementioned places and turned against proconnesus and artace after giving these also to the flames they sailed back to the chersonese to finish off the remaining cities as many as they had not destroyed at their former landing
but they did not sail against cyzicus at all the cyzicenes had already made themselves the kings subjects before the phoenician expedition by an agreement with the governor at dascyleum oebares son of megabazus
the phoenicians subdued all the cities in the chersonese except cardia miltiades son of cimon son of stesagoras was tyrant there miltiades son of cypselus had gained the rule earlier in the following manner the thracian dolonci held possession of this chersonese they were crushed in war by the apsinthians so they sent their kings to delphi to inquire about the war
the pythia answered that they should bring to their land as founder the first man who offered them hospitality after they left the sacred precinct but as the dolonci passed through phocis and boeotia going along the sacred way no one invited them so they turned toward athens
at that time in athens pisistratus held all power but miltiades son of cypselus also had great influence his household was rich enough to maintain a fourhorse chariot and he traced his earliest descent to aeacus and aegina though his later ancestry was athenian philaeus son of ajax was the first of that house to be an athenian
miltiades was sitting on his porch when he saw the dolonci go by with their foreign clothing and spears so he called out to them and when they came over he invited them in for lodging and hospitality they accepted and after he entertained them they revealed the whole story of the oracle to him and asked him to obey the god
he was persuaded as soon as he heard their speech for he was tired of pisistratus rule and wanted to be away from it he immediately set out for delphi to ask the oracle if he should do what the dolonci asked of him
the pythia also bade him do so then miltiades son of cypselus previously an olympic victor in the fourhorse chariot recruited any athenian who wanted to take part in the expedition sailed off with the dolonci and took possession of their land those who brought him appointed him tyrant
his first act was to wall off the isthmus of the chersonese from the city of cardia across to pactye so that the apsinthians would not be able to harm them by invading their land the isthmus is thirtysix stadia across and to the south of the isthmus the chersonese is four hundred and twenty stadia in length
after miltiades had pushed away the apsinthians by walling off the neck of the chersonese he made war first on the people of lampsacus but the lampsacenes laid an ambush and took him prisoner however miltiades stood high in the opinion of croesus the lydian and when croesus heard what had happened he sent to the lampsacenes and commanded them to release miltiades if they did not do so he threatened to cut them down like a pine tree
the lampsacenes went astray in their counsels as to what the utterance meant which croesus had threatened them with saying he would devastate them like a pine tree until at last one of the elders understood and said what it was the pine is the only tree that once cut down never sends out any shoots it is utterly destroyed so out of fear of croesus the lampsacenes released miltiades and let him go
so he escaped by the intervention of croesus but he later died childless and left his rule and possessions to stesagoras the son of his halfbrother cimon since his death the people of the chersonese offer sacrifices to him as their founder in the customary manner instituting a contest of horse races and gymnastics no one from lampsacus is allowed to compete
but in the war against the lampsacenes stesagoras too met his end and died childless he was struck on the head with an axe in the townhall by a man who pretended to be a deserter but in truth was an enemy and a man of violence
stesagoras met his end in this way the sons of pisistratus sent miltiades son of cimon and brother of the dead stesagoras in a trireme to the chersonese to take control of the country they had already treated him well at athens feigning that they had not been accessory to the death of cimon his father which i will relate in another place
reaching the chersonese miltiades kept himself within his house professing thus to honor the memory of his brother stesagoras when the people of the chersonese learned this their ruling men gathered together from all the cities on every side and came together in a group to show fellowfeeling with his mourning but he put them in bonds so miltiades made himself master of the chersonese there he maintained a guard of five hundred men and married hegesipyle the daughter of olorus king of thrace
but not long after this miltiades son of cimon had come to the chersonese greater difficulties than the present afflictions overtook him he had been driven from the country three years before this by the scythians the nomadic scythians provoked by darius gathered themselves together and rode as far as the chersonese
miltiades did not await their attack and fled from the chersonese until the scythians departed and the dolonci brought him back again all this had happened three years before the matters that now engaged him
but now learning that the phoenicians were in tenedos he sailed away to athens with five triremes loaded with the possessions that he had nearby he set out from cardia and crossed the black bay and as he was sailing along the chersonese the phoenicians fell upon him with their ships
miltiades himself escaped with four of his ships to imbros but the fifth was pursued and overtaken by the phoenicians it happened that the captain of this ship was metiochus the eldest son of miltiades by another wife not the daughter of olorus the thracian
the phoenicians took this man captive with his ship and when they heard that he was miltiades son they brought him up to the king thinking that this would be a very favorable service because miltiades had declared his opinion among the ionians that they should obey the scythians in their demand to break the bridge of boats and sail away to their homes
but when the phoenicians brought miltiades son metiochus before him darius did him no harm but much good giving him a house and possessions and a persian wife who bore him children who were reckoned as persians miltiades made his way from imbros to athens
in this year the persians caused no further trouble for the ionians and at this same time certain things happened which greatly benefited the ionians artaphrenes governor of sardis summoned ambassadors from the cities and compelled the ionians to make agreements among themselves that they would abide by the law and not rob and plunder each other
he compelled them to do this and he measured their lands by parasangs which is the persian name for a distance of thirty stadia and ordered that each people should according to this measurement pay a tribute which has remained fixed as assessed by artaphrenes ever since that time up to this day the sum appointed was about the same as that which they had rendered before this then kept them peaceable
but at the beginning of spring the other generals were deposed by the king from their offices and mardonius son of gobryas a man young in years and recently married to darius daughter artozostre came down to the coast at the head of a very great army and fleet
when mardonius reached cilicia at the head of this army he himself embarked on shipboard and sailed with the rest of his ships while other captains led the land army to the hellespont
when mardonius arrived in ionia in his voyage along the coast of asia he did a thing which i here set down for the wonder of those greeks who will not believe otanes to have declared his opinion among the seven that democracy was best for persia mardonius deposed all the ionian tyrants and set up democracies in their cities
he did this and hurried to the hellespont when a great multitude of ships and a great army were assembled the persians crossed the hellespont on shipboard and marched through europe with eretria and athens as their goal
this was the stated end of their expedition but they intended to subdue as many of the greek cities as they could their fleet subdued the thasians who did not so much as lift up their hands against it their land army added the macedonians to the slaves that they had already for all the nations nearer to them than macedonia had been made subject to the persians before this
crossing over from thasos they travelled near the land as far as acanthus and putting out from there they tried to round athos but a great and irresistible north wind fell upon them as they sailed past and dealt very roughly with them driving many of their ships upon athos
it is said that about three hundred ships were lost and more than twenty thousand men since the coasts of athos abound in wild beasts some men were carried off by beasts and so perished others were dashed against the rocks those who could not swim perished because of that and still others by the cold
thus it fared with the fleet as for mardonius and his land army while they were encamped in macedonia the brygi of thrace attacked them by night and killed many of them wounding mardonius himself but not even these could escape being enslaved by the persians mardonius did not depart from those lands before he had subjugated them
after conquering them he led his army away homewards since the brygi had dealt a heavy blow to his army and athos an even heavier blow to his fleet this expedition after an inglorious adventure returned back to asia
in the next year after this darius first sent a message bidding the thasians who were falsely reported by their neighbors to be planning rebellion to destroy their walls and bring their ships to abdera
since they had been besieged by histiaeus of miletus and had great revenues the thasians had used their wealth to build ships of war and surround themselves with stronger walls
their revenue came from the mainland and from the mines about eighty talents on average came in from the goldmines of the dug forest and less from the mines of thasos itself yet so much that the thasians paying no tax on their crops drew a yearly revenue from the mainland and the mines of two hundred talents on average and three hundred when the revenue was greatest
i myself have seen these mines by far the most marvellous were those that were found by the phoenicians who with thasos colonized this island which is now called after that phoenician thasos
these phoenician mines are between the place called aenyra and coenyra in thasos opposite samothrace they are in a great hill that has been dug up in the searching so much for that the thasians at the kings command destroyed their walls and brought all their ships to abdera
then darius attempted to learn whether the greeks intended to wage war against him or to surrender themselves he sent heralds this way and that throughout hellas bidding them demand a gift of earth and water for the king
he despatched some to hellas and he sent others to his own tributary cities of the coast commanding that ships of war and transports for horses be built
so the cities set about these preparations the heralds who went to hellas received what the kings proclamation demanded from many of those dwelling on the mainland and from all the islanders to whom they came with the demand among the islanders who gave earth and water to darius were the aeginetans
the athenians immediately came down upon them for doing this for they supposed the aeginetans to have given the gift out of enmity for athens so they might join with the persians in attacking the athenians gladly laying hold of this pretext they went to sparta and there accused the aeginetans of acting to betray hellas
regarding this accusation cleomenes son of anaxandrides king of sparta crossed over to aegina intending to arrest the most culpable of its people
but when he attempted to make the arrests the aeginetans opposed him especially crius son of polycritus who told him he would not take away any aeginetan with impunity for he had no authority from the spartans for what he was doing instead he had been bribed by the athenians otherwise he would have come to make the arrests with the other king he said this because of a letter from demaratus
driven from aegina cleomenes asked crius his name and when crius told him what it was cleomenes said to him now is the time to put bronze on your horns mr ram for great calamity will confront you
all this time demaratus son of ariston remained at sparta and spread evil reports of cleomenes this demaratus was also king of sparta but of the inferior house not indeed inferior in any other regard for they have a common ancestor but the house of eurysthenes has in some sort the greater honor by right of primogeniture
the lacedaemonians say but no poet agrees that it was aristodemus son of aristomachus son of cleodaeus son of hyllus and not his sons who led them to that land which they now possess
after no long time aristodemus wife whose name was argeia bore him offspring they say she was daughter of autesion son of tisamenus son of thersander son of polynices she bore him twins aristodemus lived to see the children then died of a sickness
the lacedaemonians of that day planned to follow their custom and make the eldest of the children king but the children were identical in all respects so the lacedaemonians did not know which to choose when they could not judge between them or perhaps even before this they asked the mother
she said she knew no better than the lacedaemonians which was the elder she knew perfectly well but she said this because she desired that by some means both might be made kings the lacedaemonians were at a loss so they sent to delphi to inquire how they should deal with the matter
the priestess bade them make both children kings but give greater honor to the elder when the priestess gave this response the lacedaemonians knew no better than before how to discover the elder child and a man of messenia whose name was panites gave them advice
he advised them to watch the mother and see which of the children she washed and fed before the other if she was seen to do this always in the same order they would then have all that they sought and desired to discover but if she changed her practice haphazardly then it would be manifest to the lacedaemonians that she know no more than they did and they must have recourse to some other means
then the spartans did as the messenian advised as they watched the mother of aristodemus children they found her always preferring the elder when she fed and washed them since she did not know why she was being watched so they took the child that was preferred by its mother and brought it up at public expense as the firstborn and they called it eurysthenes and the other procles
they say that when these two brothers grew to manhood they feuded with each other as long as they lived and their descendants continued to do likewise
the lacedaemonians are the only greeks who tell this story but in what i write i follow the greek report and hold that the greeks correctly recount these kings of the dorians as far back as perseus son of danae they make no mention of the god  and prove these kings to be greek for by that time they had come to be classified as greeks
i said as far back as perseus and i took the matter no further than that because no one is named as the mortal father of perseus as amphitryon is named father of heracles so i used correct reasoning when i said that the greek record is correct as far back as perseus farther back than that if the kings ancestors in each generation from danae daughter of acrisius upward be reckoned then the leaders of the dorians will be shown to be trueborn egyptians
thus have i traced their lineage according to the greek story but the persian tale is that perseus himself was an assyrian and became a greek which his forebears had not been the persians say that the ancestors of acrisius had no bond of kinship with perseus and they indeed were as the greeks say egyptians
enough of these matters why and for what achievements these men being egyptian won the kingship of the dorians has been told by others so i will let it go and will make mention of matters which others have not touched
these privileges the spartans have given to their kings two priesthoods of zeus called lacedaemon and of zeus of heaven they wage war against whatever land they wish and no spartan can hinder them in this on peril of being put under a curse when the armies go forth the kings go out first and return last one hundred chosen men guard them in their campaigns they sacrifice as many sheep and goats as they wish at the start of their expeditions and take the hides and backs of all sacrificed beasts
such are their rights in war in peace the powers given them are as follows at all public sacrifices the kings first sit down to the banquet and are first served each of them receiving a portion double of what is given to the rest of the company they make the first libations and the hides of the sacrificed beasts are theirs
at each new moon and each seventh day of the first part of the month a fullgrown victim for apollos temple a bushel of barleymeal and a laconian quart of wine are given to each from the public store and chief seats are set apart for them at the games
it is their right to appoint whatever citizens they wish to be protectors of foreigners and they each choose two pythians the pythians are the ambassadors to delphi and eat with the kings at the public expense  if the kings do not come to the public dinner two choenixes of barleymeal and half a pint of wine are sent to their houses but when they come they receive a double share of everything and the same honor shall be theirs when they are invited by private citizens to dinner
they keep all oracles that are given though the pythians also know them the kings alone judge cases concerning the rightful possessor of an unwedded heiress if her father has not betrothed her and cases concerning public roads
if a man desires to adopt a son it is done in the presence of the kings they sit with the twentyeight elders in council if they do not come the elders most closely related to them hold the kings privilege giving two votes over and above the third which is their own
the kings are granted these rights from the spartan commonwealth while they live when they die their rights are as follows horsemen proclaim their death in all parts of laconia and in the city women go about beating on cauldrons when this happens two free persons from each house a man and a woman are required to wear mourning or incur heavy penalties if they fail to do so
the lacedaemonians have the same custom at the deaths of their kings as the foreigners in asia most foreigners use the same custom at their kings deaths when a king of the lacedaemonians dies a fixed number of their subject neighbors must come to the funeral from all lacedaemon besides the spartans
when these and the helots and the spartans themselves have assembled in one place to the number of many thousands together with the women they zealously beat their foreheads and make long and loud lamentation calling that king that is most recently dead the best of all their kings whenever a king dies in war they make an image of him and carry it out on a wellspread bier for ten days after the burial there are no assemblies or elections and they mourn during these days
the lacedaemonians also resemble the persians in this when one king is dead and another takes his office this successor releases from debt any spartan who owes a debt to the king or to the commonwealth among the persians the king at the beginning of his reign forgives all cities their arrears of tribute
the lacedaemonians resemble the egyptians in that their heralds and fluteplayers and cooks inherit the craft from their fathers a fluteplayers son being a fluteplayer and a cooks son a cook and a heralds son a herald no others usurp their places making themselves heralds by loudness of voice they ply their craft by right of birth such is the way of these matters
while cleomenes was in aegina working for the common good of hellas demaratus slandered him not out of care for the aeginetans but out of jealousy and envy once cleomenes returned home from aegina he planned to remove demaratus from his kingship using the following affair as a pretext against him ariston king of sparta had married twice but had no children
he did not admit that he himself was responsible so he married a third time this is how it came about he had among the spartans a friend to whom he was especially attached this mans wife was by far the most beautiful woman in sparta but she who was now most beautiful had once been the ugliest
her nurse considered her inferior looks and how she was of wealthy people yet unattractive and seeing how the parents felt her appearance to be a great misfortune she contrived to carry the child every day to the sacred precinct of helen which is in the place called therapne beyond the sacred precinct of phoebus every time the nurse carried the child there she set her beside the image and beseeched the goddess to release the child from her ugliness
once as she was leaving the sacred precinct it is said that a woman appeared to her and asked her what she was carrying in her arms the nurse said she was carrying a child and the woman bade her show it to her but she refused saying that the parents had forbidden her to show it to anyone but the woman strongly bade her show it to her
and when the nurse saw how important it was to her she showed her the child the woman stroked the childs head and said that she would be the most beautiful woman in all sparta from that day her looks changed and when she reached the time for marriage agetus son of alcidas married her this man was aristons friend
so love for this woman pricked ariston and he contrived as follows he promised to give to his comrade any one thing out of all he owned whatever agetus might choose and he bade his comrade make him the same promise agetus had no fear about his wife seeing that ariston was already married so he agreed and they took oaths on these terms
ariston gave agetus whatever it was that he chose out of all his treasures and then seeking equal recompense from him tried to take the wife of his comrade agetus said that he had agreed to anything but that but he was forced by his oath and by the deceitful trick to let his wife be taken
in this way ariston married his third wife after divorcing the second one but his new wife gave birth to demaratus too soon before ten lunar months had passed
when one of his servants announced to him as he sat in council with the ephors that he had a son ariston knowing the time of the marriage counted up the months on his fingers and swore on oath its not mine the ephors heard this but did not make anything of it when the boy grew up ariston regretted having said that for he firmly believed demaratus to be his own son
he named him demaratus because before his birth all the spartan populace had prayed that ariston the man most highly esteemed out of all the kings of sparta might have a son thus he was named demaratus which means answer to the peoples prayer
time passed and ariston died so demaratus held the kingship but it seems that these matters had to become known and cause demaratus to lose his kingship he had already fallen out with cleomenes when he had brought the army back from eleusis and now they were even more at odds when cleomenes crossed over after the aeginetans who were medizing
cleomenes wanted revenge so he made a deal with leotychides son of menares son of agis of the same family as demaratus the deal was that leotychides would go with cleomenes against the aeginetans if he became king
leotychides had already become strongly hostile to demaratus for the following reason leotychides was betrothed to percalus daughter of demarmenus but demaratus plotted and robbed him of his marriage stealing percalus and marrying her first
from this affair leotychides was hostile toward demaratus so at cleomenes instigation he took an oath against him saying that he was not king of the spartans by right since he was not aristons son after making this oath he prosecuted him recalling that utterance which ariston had made when the servant told him he had a son and he counted up the months and swore that it was not his
taking his stand on this remark leotychides declared that demaratus was not aristons son and that he was not rightly king of sparta bringing as witnesses the ephors who had been sitting beside ariston and heard him say this
disputes arose over it so the spartans resolved to ask the oracle at delphi if demaratus was the son of ariston
at cleomenes instigation this was revealed to the pythia he had won over a man of great influence among the delphians cobon son of aristophantus and cobon persuaded the priestess periallus to say what cleomenes wanted her to
when the ambassadors asked if demaratus was the son of ariston the pythia gave judgment that he was not all this came to light later cobon was exiled from delphi and periallus was deposed from her position
so it was concerning demaratus loss of the kingship and from sparta he went into exile among the medes because of the following reproach after he was deposed from the kingship he was elected to office
when it was the time of the gymnopaidia leotychides now king in his place saw him in the audience and as a joke and an insult sent a messenger to him to ask what it was like to hold office after being king
he was grieved by the question and said that he had experience of both while leotychides did not and that this question would be the beginning for sparta of either immense evil or immense good fortune he said this covered his head left the theater and went home where he immediately made preparations and sacrificed an ox to zeus then he summoned his mother
when she came in he put some of the entrails in her hands and entreated her saying mother appealing to zeus of the household and to all the other gods i beseech you to tell me the truth who is my father tell me truly
leotychides said in the disputes that you were already pregnant by your former husband when you came to ariston others say more foolishly that you approached to one of the servants the asskeeper and that i am his son
i adjure you by the gods to speak what is true if you have done anything of what they say you are not the only one you are in company with many women there is much talk at sparta that ariston did not have childbearing seed in him or his former wives would have given him children
thus he spoke his mother answered my son since you adjure me by entreaties to speak the truth i will speak out to you all that is true on the third night after ariston brought me to his house a phantom resembling him came to me it came and lay with me and then put on me the garlands which it had
it went away and when ariston came in later and saw me with the garlands he asked who gave them to me i said he did but he denied it i swore an oath that just a little while before he had come in and lain with me and given me the garlands and i said it was not good of him to deny it
when he saw me swearing he perceived that this was some divine affair for the garlands had clearly come from the heros precinct which is established at the courtyard doors which they call the precinct of astrabacus and the seers responded that this was the same hero who had come to me thus my son you have all you want to know
either you are from this hero and astrabacus the hero is your father or ariston is for i conceived you that night as for how your enemies chiefly attack you saying that ariston himself when your birth was announced denied in front of a large audience that you were his because the ten months had not yet been completed he spoke an idle word out of ignorance of such things
some women give birth after nine months or seven months not all complete the ten months i gave birth to you my son after seven months a little later ariston himself recognized that he had blurted out that speech because of foolishness do not believe other stories about your manner of birth you have heard the whole truth may the wife of leotychides himself and the wives of the others who say these things give birth to children fathered by asskeepers
thus his mother spoke after learning what he desired demaratus took provisions and travelled to elis pretending that he was going to delphi to inquire of the oracle but the lacedaemonians suspected that he planned to escape and went in pursuit
demaratus somehow went across to zacynthus from elis before them the lacedaemonians crossed over after him and laid hands on him carrying off his servants but the zacynthians refused to give him up and later he crossed from there to asia and went to king darius who received him in grand style and gave him lands and cities
so demaratus reached asia through such chances a man who had gained much renown in lacedaemon by his many achievements and his wisdom and by conferring on the state the victory in a chariotrace he had won at olympia he was the only king of sparta who did this
leutychides son of menares succeeded to the kingship after demaratus was deposed a son was born to him zeuxidemus called by some of the spartans cyniscus this zeuxidemus never became king of sparta for he died before leutychides leaving his son archidemus
after the loss of zeuxidemus leutychides married a second wife eurydame sister of menius and daughter of diactorides by her he had no male offspring but a daughter lampito to whom archidemus son of zeuxidemus was married by leutychides
but leutychides also did not come to old age in sparta he was punished for his dealings with demaratus as i will show he led a lacedaemonian army to thessaly and when he could have subdued all the country he took a great bribe
after being caught in the act of hoarding a sleeve full of silver there in the camp he was brought before a court and banished from sparta and his house was destroyed he went into exile at tegea and died in that country
this happened long afterwards when cleomenes dealings with demaratus came off successfully he immediately took leutychides with him and went to punish the aeginetans with whom he was terribly angry because of their insulting behavior
when the aeginetans saw that both kings had come after them they now deemed it best to offer no further resistance the kings chose ten men of aegina who were most honored for wealth and lineage among them crius son of polycritus and casambus son of aristocrates the two most powerful men in aegina they carried them to attica and gave them into the keeping of the athenians the bitterest foes of the aeginetans
later cleomenes treacherous plot against demaratus became known he was seized with fear of the spartans and secretly fled to thessaly from there he came to arcadia and stirred up disorder uniting the arcadians against sparta among his methods of binding them by oath to follow him wherever he led was his zeal to bring the chief men of arcadia to the city of nonacris and make them swear by the water of the styx
near this city is said to be the arcadian water of the styx and this is its nature it is a stream of small appearance dropping from a cliff into a pool a wall of stones runs round the pool nonacris where this spring rises is a city of arcadia near pheneus
when the lacedaemonians learned that cleomenes was doing this they took fright and brought him back to sparta to rule on the same terms as before cleomenes had already been not entirely in his right mind and on his return from exile a mad sickness fell upon him any spartan that he happened to meet he would hit in the face with his staff
for doing this and because he was out of his mind his relatives bound him in the stocks when he was in the stocks and saw that his guard was left alone he demanded a dagger the guard at first refused to give it but cleomenes threatened what he would do to him when he was freed until the guard who was a helot was frightened by the threats and gave him the dagger
cleomenes took the weapon and set about slashing himself from his shins upwards from the shin to the thigh he cut his flesh lengthways then from the thigh to the hip and the sides until he reached the belly and cut it into strips thus he died as most of the greeks say because he persuaded the pythian priestess to tell the tale of demaratus the athenians alone say it was because he invaded eleusis and laid waste the precinct of the gods the argives say it was because when argives had taken refuge after the battle in their temple of argus he brought them out and cut them down then paid no heed to the sacred grove and set it on fire
as cleomenes was seeking divination at delphi the oracle responded that he would take argos when he came with spartans to the river erasinus which is said to flow from the stymphalian lake this lake issues into a cleft out of sight and reappears at argos and from that place onwards the stream is called by the argives erasinus） when cleomenes came to this river he offered sacrifices to it
the omens were in no way favorable for his crossing so he said that he honored the erasinus for not betraying its countrymen but even so the argives would not go unscathed then he withdrew and led his army seaward to thyrea where he sacrificed a bull to the sea and carried his men on shipboard to the region of tiryns and to nauplia
the argives heard of this and came to the coast to do battle with him when they had come near tiryns and were at the place called hesipeia they encamped opposite the lacedaemonians leaving only a little space between the armies there the argives had no fear of fair fighting but rather of being captured by a trick
this was the affair referred to by that oracle which the pythian priestess gave to the argives and milesians in common which ran thus
when the female defeats the male
and drives him away winning glory in argos
she will make many argive women tear their cheeks
as someday one of men to come will say
the dread thricecoiled serpent died tamed by the spear
all these things coming together spread fear among the argives therefore they resolved to defend themselves by making use of the enemies herald and they performed their resolve in this way whenever the spartan herald signalled anything to the lacedaemonians the argives did the same thing
when cleomenes saw that the argives did whatever was signalled by his herald he commanded that when the herald cried the signal for breakfast they should then put on their armor and attack the argives
the lacedaemonians performed this command and when they assaulted the argives they caught them at breakfast in obedience to the heralds signal they killed many of them and far more fled for refuge into the grove of argus which the lacedaemonians encamped around and guarded
then cleomenes plan was this he had with him some deserters from whom he learned the names then he sent a herald calling by name the argives that were shut up in the sacred precinct and inviting them to come out saying that he had their ransom among the peloponnesians there is a fixed ransom of two minae to be paid for every prisoner so cleomenes invited about fifty argives to come out one after another and murdered them
somehow the rest of the men in the temple precinct did not know this was happening for the grove was thick and those inside could not see how those outside were faring until one of them climbed a tree and saw what was being done thereafter they would not come out at the heralds call
then cleomenes bade all the helots pile wood about the grove they obeyed and he burnt the grove when the fire was now burning he asked of one of the deserters to what god the grove belonged the man said it was of argos when he heard that he groaned aloud apollo god of oracles you have gravely deceived me by saying that i would take argos this i guess is the fulfillment of that prophecy
then cleomenes sent most of his army back to sparta while he himself took a thousand of the best warriors and went to the temple of hera to sacrifice when he wished to sacrifice at the altar the priest forbade him saying that it was not holy for a stranger to sacrifice there cleomenes ordered the helots to carry the priest away from the altar and whip him and he performed the sacrifice after doing this he returned to sparta
but after his return his enemies brought him before the ephors saying that he had been bribed not to take argos when he might have easily taken it cleomenes alleged whether falsely or truly i cannot rightly say but this he alleged in his speech that he had supposed the gods oracle to be fulfilled by his taking of the temple of argus therefore he had thought it best not to make any attempt on the city before he had learned from the sacrifices whether the god would deliver it to him or withstand him
when he was taking omens in heras temple a flame of fire had shone forth from the breast of the image and so he learned the truth of the matter that he would not take argos if the flame had come out of the head of the image he would have taken the city from head to foot utterly but its coming from the breast signified that he had done as much as the god willed to happen this plea of his seemed to the spartans to be credible and reasonable and he far outdistanced the pursuit of his accusers
but argos was so wholly deprived of men that their slaves took possession of all affairs ruling and governing until the sons of the slain men grew up then they recovered argos for themselves and cast out the slaves when they were driven out the slaves took possession of tiryns by force
for a while they were at peace with each other but then there came to the slaves a prophet cleander a man of phigalea in arcadia by birth he persuaded the slaves to attack their masters from that time there was a longlasting war between them until with difficulty the argives got the upper hand
the argives say this was the reason cleomenes went mad and met an evil end the spartans themselves say that cleomenes madness arose from no divine agent but that by consorting with scythians he became a drinker of strong wine and the madness came from this
the nomadic scythians after darius had invaded their land were eager for revenge so they sent to sparta and made an alliance they agreed that the scythians would attempt to invade media by way of the river phasis and they urged the spartans to set out and march inland from ephesus and meet the scythians
they say that when the scythians had come for this purpose cleomenes kept rather close company with them and by consorting with them more than was fitting he learned from them to drink strong wine the spartans consider him to have gone mad from this ever since as they themselves say whenever they desire a strong drink they call for a scythian cup such is the spartan story of cleomenes but to my thinking it was for what he did to demaratus that he was punished thus
when the aeginetans heard that cleomenes was dead they sent messengers to sparta to cry out against leutychides concerning the hostages that were held at athens the lacedaemonians then assembled a court and gave judgment that leutychides had done violence to the aeginetans and they condemned him to be given up and carried to aegina in requital for the men that were held at athens
but when the aeginetans were about to carry leutychides away a man of repute at sparta theasides son of leoprepes said to them men of aegina what are you planning to do to have the king of the spartans given up to you by the citizens and carry him away if the spartans have now so judged in their anger see that they do not bring utter destruction upon your country if you do this
the aeginetans heard this and refrained from carrying the king away and made an agreement that leutychides should go with them to athens and restore the men to the aeginetans
when leutychides came to athens and demanded back the hostages the athenians were unwilling to give them back and made excuses saying that two kings had given them the trust and they deemed it wrong to restore it to one without the other
when the athenians refused to give them back leutychides said to them men of athens do whichever thing you desire if you give them back you do righteously if you do not give them back you do the opposite but i want to tell you the story of what happened at sparta in the matter of a trust
we spartans say that three generations ago there was at lacedaemon one glaucus the son of epicydes we say that this man added to his other excellences a reputation for justice above all men who at that time dwelt in lacedaemon
but we say that at the fitting time this befell him there came to sparta a certain man of miletus who desired to have a talk with glaucus and made him this offer ‘i am a milesian and i have come to have the benefit of your justice glaucus
since there is much talk about your justice throughout all the rest of hellas and even in ionia i considered the fact that ionia is always in danger while the peloponnese is securely established and nowhere in ionia are the same men seen continuing in possession of wealth
considering and taking counsel concerning these matters i resolved to turn half of my property into silver and deposit it with you being well assured that it will lie safe for me in your keeping accept the money for me and take and keep these tokens restore the money to whoever comes with the same tokens and demands it back’
thus spoke the stranger who had come from miletus and glaucus received the trust according to the agreement after a long time had passed the sons of the man who had deposited the money came to sparta they spoke with glaucus showing him the tokens and demanding the money back
but glaucus put them off and answered in turn ‘i do not remember the matter and nothing of what you say carries my mind back let me think i wish to do all that is just if i took the money i will duly restore it if i never took it at all i will deal with you according to the customs of the greeks i will put off making my decision for you until the fourth month from this day’
so the milesians went away in sorrow as men robbed of their possessions but glaucus journeyed to delphi to question the oracle when he asked the oracle whether he should seize the money under oath the pythian priestess threatened him in these verses
glaucus son of epicydes it is more profitable now
to prevail by your oath and seize the money
swear for death awaits even the man who swears true
but oath has a son nameless he is without hands
or feet but he pursues swiftly until he catches
and destroys all the family and the entire house
the line of a man who swears true is better later on
when glaucus heard this he entreated the god to pardon him for what he had said the priestess answered that to tempt the god and to do the deed had the same effect
so glaucus summoned the milesian strangers and gave them back their money but hear now athenians why i began to tell you this story there is today no descendant of glaucus nor any household that bears glaucus name he has been utterly rooted out of sparta so good is it not even to think anything concerning a trust except giving it back on demand
thus spoke leutychides but even so the athenians would not listen to him and he departed the aeginetans before paying the penalty for the violence they had done to the athenians to please the thebans acted as follows blaming the athenians and deeming themselves wronged they prepared to take vengeance on the athenians who were now celebrating a quinquennial festival at sunium the aeginetans set an ambush and captured the sacred ship with many leading athenians on board and put in prison the men they seized
suffering this from the aeginetans the athenians no longer put off devising all mischief against aegina there was a notable man in aegina nicodromus son of cnoethus by name who held a grudge against the aeginetans for his former banishment from the island when he learned that the athenians were now set upon harming the aeginetans he agreed to betray aegina to the athenians naming the day when he would make the attempt and when they must come to aid him
later nicodromus according to his agreement with the athenians took possession of the old city as it was called but the athenians were not there at the right time for they did not have ships worthy to fight the aeginetans while they were asking the corinthians to lend them ships the affair was ruined the corinthians at that time were their close friends so they consented to the athenians plea and gave them twenty ships at a price of five drachmas apiece by their law they could not make a free gift of them taking these ships and their own the athenians manned seventy in all and sailed for aegina but they came a day later than the time agreed
when the athenians did not show up at the right time nicodromus took ship and escaped from aegina other aeginetans followed him and the athenians gave them sunium to dwell in setting out from there they harried the aeginetans of the island
but this happened later the rich men of aegina gained mastery over the people who had risen against them with nicodromus then made them captive and led them out to be killed because of this a curse fell upon them which despite all their efforts they could not get rid of by sacrifice and they were driven out of their island before the goddess would be merciful to them
they had taken seven hundred of the people alive as they led these out for slaughter one of them escaped from his bonds and fled to the temple gate of demeter the lawgiver where he laid hold of the doorhandles and clung to them they could not tear him away by force so they cut off his hands and carried him off and those hands were left clinging fast to the doorhandles
thus the aeginetans dealt with each other when the athenians came they fought them at sea with seventy ships the aeginetans were defeated in the seafight and asked for help from the argives as they had done before but this time the argives would not aid them holding a grudge because ships of aegina had been taken by force by cleomenes and put in on the argolid coast where their crews landed with the lacedaemonians men from ships of sicyon also took part in the same invasion
the argives laid on them the payment of a fine of a thousand talents five hundred each the sicyonians confessed that they had done wrong and agreed to go free with a payment of a hundred talents but the aeginetans made no such confession and remained stubborn for this cause the argive state sent no one to aid them at their request but about a thousand came voluntarily led by a captain whose name was eurybates a man who practiced the pentathlon
most of these never returned meeting their death at the hands of the athenians in aegina eurybates himself their captain fought in single combat and thus killed three men but was slain by the fourth sophanes the son of deceles
the aeginetan ships found the athenians in disarray and attacked and overcame them taking four athenian ships and their crews
thus athens and aegina grappled together in war the persian was going about his own business for his servant was constantly reminding him to remember the athenians and the pisistratidae were at his elbow maligning the athenians moreover darius desired to take this pretext for subduing all the men of hellas who had not given him earth and water
he dismissed from command mardonius who had fared so badly on his expedition and appointed other generals to lead his armies against athens and eretria datis a mede by birth and his own nephew artaphrenes son of artaphrenes the order he gave them at their departure was to enslave athens and eretria and bring the slaves into his presence
when these appointed generals on their way from the king reached the aleian plain in cilicia bringing with them a great and wellfurnished army they camped there and were overtaken by all the fleet that was assigned to each there also arrived the transports for horses which in the previous year darius had bidden his tributary subjects to make ready
having loaded the horses into these and embarked the land army in the ships they sailed to ionia with six hundred triremes from there they held their course not by the mainland and straight towards the hellespont and thrace but setting forth from samos they sailed by the icarian sea and from island to island this to my thinking was because they feared above all the voyage around athos seeing that in the previous year they had come to great disaster by holding their course that way moreover naxos was still unconquered and constrained them
when they approached naxos from the icarian sea and came to land for it was naxos which the persians intended to attack first the naxians remembering what had happened before fled away to the mountains instead of waiting for them the persians enslaved all of them that they caught and burnt their temples and their city after doing this they set sail for the other islands
while they did this the delians also left delos and fled away to tenos as his expedition was sailing landwards datis went on ahead and bade his fleet anchor not off delos but across the water off rhenaea learning where the delians were he sent a herald to them with this proclamation
holy men why have you fled away and so misjudged my intent it is my own desire and the kings command to me to do no harm to the land where the two gods were born neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants so return now to your homes and dwell on your island he made this proclamation to the delians and then piled up three hundred talents of frankincense on the altar and burnt it
after doing this datis sailed with his army against eretria first taking with him ionians and aeolians and after he had put out from there delos was shaken by an earthquake the first and last as the delians say before my time this portent was sent by heaven as i suppose to be an omen of the ills that were coming on the world
for in three generations that is in the time of darius son of hystaspes and xerxes son of darius and artaxerxes son of xerxes more ills happened to hellas than in twenty generations before darius some coming from the persians some from the wars for preeminence among the chief of the nations themselves
thus it was no marvel that there should be an earthquake in delos when there had been none before also there was an oracle concerning delos where it was written
i will shake delos though unshaken before
in the greek language these names have the following meanings darius is the doer xerxes the warrior artaxerxes the great warrior the greeks would rightly call the kings thus in their language
launching out to sea from delos the foreigners put in at the islands and gathered an army from there taking the sons of the islanders for hostages
when in their voyage about the islands they put in at carystos the carystians gave them no hostages and refused to join them against neighboring cities meaning eretria and athens the persians besieged them and laid waste their land until the carystians too came over to their side
when the eretrians learned that the persian expedition was sailing to attack them they asked for help from the athenians the athenians did not refuse the aid but gave them for defenders the four thousand tenant farmers who held the land of the chalcidian horsebreeders  but it seems that all the plans of the eretrians were unsound they sent to the athenians for aid but their counsels were divided
some of them planned to leave the city and make for the heights of euboea others plotted treason in hope of winning advantages from the persians
when aeschines son of nothon a leading man in eretria learned of both designs he told the athenians who had come how matters stood and asked them to depart to their own country so they would not perish like the rest the athenians followed aeschines advice
so they saved themselves by crossing over to oropus the persians sailed holding their course for temenos and choereae and aegilea all in eretrian territory landing at these places they immediately unloaded their horses and made preparation to attack their enemies
the eretrians had no intention of coming out and fighting all their care was to guard their walls if they could since it was the prevailing counsel not to leave the city the walls were strongly attacked and for six days many fell on both sides but on the seventh two eretrians of repute euphorbus son of alcimachus and philagrus son of cineas betrayed the city to the persians
they entered the city and plundered and burnt the temples in revenge for the temples that were burnt at sardis moreover they enslaved the townspeople according to darius command
after subduing eretria the persians waited a few days and then sailed away to the land of attica pressing ahead in expectation of doing to the athenians exactly what they had done to the eretrians marathon was the place in attica most suitable for riding horses and closest to eretria so hippias son of pisistratus led them there
when the athenians learned this they too marched out to marathon with ten generals leading them the tenth was miltiades and it had befallen his father cimon son of stesagoras to be banished from athens by pisistratus son of hippocrates
while in exile he happened to take the olympic prize in the fourhorse chariot and by taking this victory he won the same prize as his halfbrother miltiades at the next olympic games he won with the same horses but permitted pisistratus to be proclaimed victor and by resigning the victory to him he came back from exile to his own property under truce
after taking yet another olympic prize with the same horses he happened to be murdered by pisistratus sons since pisistratus was no longer living they murdered him by placing men in ambush at night near the townhall cimon was buried in front of the city across the road called through the hollow and buried opposite him are the mares who won the three olympic prizes
the mares of evagoras the laconian did the same as these but none others stesagoras the elder of cimons sons was then being brought up with his uncle miltiades in the chersonese the younger was with cimon at athens and he took the name miltiades from miltiades the founder of the chersonese
it was this miltiades who was now the athenian general after coming from the chersonese and escaping a twofold death the phoenicians pursued him as far as imbros considering it of great importance to catch him and bring him to the king
he escaped from them but when he reached his own country and thought he was safe then his enemies met him they brought him to court and prosecuted him for tyranny in the chersonese but he was acquitted and appointed athenian general chosen by the people
while still in the city the generals first sent to sparta the herald philippides an athenian and a longdistance runner who made that his calling as philippides himself said when he brought the message to the athenians when he was in the parthenian mountain above tegea he encountered pan
pan called out philippides name and bade him ask the athenians why they paid him no attention though he was of goodwill to the athenians had often been of service to them and would be in the future
the athenians believed that these things were true and when they became prosperous they established a sacred precinct of pan beneath the acropolis ever since that message they propitiate him with annual sacrifices and a torchrace
this philippides was in sparta on the day after leaving the city of athens that time when he was sent by the generals and said that pan had appeared to him he came to the magistrates and said
lacedaemonians the athenians ask you to come to their aid and not allow the most ancient city among the hellenes to fall into slavery at the hands of the foreigners even now eretria has been enslaved and hellas has become weaker by an important city
he told them what he had been ordered to say and they resolved to send help to the athenians but they could not do this immediately for they were unwilling to break the law it was the ninth day of the rising month and they said that on the ninth they could not go out to war until the moons circle was full
so they waited for the full moon while the foreigners were guided to marathon by hippias son of pisistratus the previous night hippias had a dream in which he slept with his mother
he supposed from the dream that he would return from exile to athens recover his rule and end his days an old man in his own country thus he reckoned from the dream then as guide he unloaded the slaves from eretria onto the island of the styrians called aegilia and brought to anchor the ships that had put ashore at marathon then marshalled the foreigners who had disembarked onto land
as he was tending to this he happened to sneeze and cough more violently than usual since he was an elderly man most of his teeth were loose and he lost one of them by the force of his cough it fell into the sand and he expended much effort in looking for it but the tooth could not be found
he groaned aloud and said to those standing by him this land is not ours and we will not be able to subdue it my tooth holds whatever share of it was mine
hippias supposed that the dream had in this way come true as the athenians were marshalled in the precinct of heracles the plataeans came to help them in full force the plataeans had put themselves under the protection of the athenians and the athenians had undergone many labors on their behalf this is how they did it
when the plataeans were pressed by the thebans they first tried to put themselves under the protection of cleomenes son of anaxandrides and the lacedaemonians who happened to be there but they did not accept them saying we live too far away and our help would be cold comfort to you you could be enslaved many times over before any of us heard about it
we advise you to put yourselves under the protection of the athenians since they are your neighbors and not bad men at giving help the lacedaemonians gave this advice not so much out of goodwill toward the plataeans as wishing to cause trouble for the athenians with the boeotians
so the lacedaemonians gave this advice to the plataeans who did not disobey it when the athenians were making sacrifices to the twelve gods they sat at the altar as suppliants and put themselves under protection when the thebans heard this they marched against the plataeans but the athenians came to their aid
as they were about to join battle the corinthians who happened to be there prevented them and brought about a reconciliation since both sides desired them to arbitrate they fixed the boundaries of the country on condition that the thebans leave alone those boeotians who were unwilling to be enrolled as boeotian  after rendering this decision the corinthians departed the boeotians attacked the athenians as they were leaving but were defeated in battle
the athenians went beyond the boundaries the corinthians had made for the plataeans fixing the asopus river as the boundary for the thebans in the direction of plataea and hysiae so the plataeans had put themselves under the protection of the athenians in the aforesaid manner and now came to help at marathon
the athenian generals were of divided opinion some advocating not fighting because they were too few to attack the army of the medes others including miltiades advocating fighting
thus they were at odds and the inferior plan prevailed an eleventh man had a vote chosen by lot to be polemarch of athens and by ancient custom the athenians had made his vote of equal weight with the generals callimachus of aphidnae was polemarch at this time miltiades approached him and said
callimachus it is now in your hands to enslave athens or make her free and thereby leave behind for all posterity a memorial such as not even harmodius and aristogeiton left now the athenians have come to their greatest danger since they first came into being and if we surrender it is clear what we will suffer when handed over to hippias but if the city prevails it will take first place among hellenic cities
i will tell you how this can happen and how the deciding voice on these matters has devolved upon you the ten generals are of divided opinion some urging to attack others urging not to
if we do not attack now i expect that great strife will fall upon and shake the spirit of the athenians leading them to medize but if we attack now before anything unsound corrupts the athenians we can win the battle if the gods are fair
all this concerns and depends on you in this way if you vote with me your country will be free and your city the first in hellas but if you side with those eager to avoid battle you will have the opposite to all the good things i enumerated
by saying this miltiades won over callimachus the polemarchs vote was counted in and the decision to attack was resolved upon thereafter the generals who had voted to fight turned the presidency over to miltiades as each ones day came in turn he accepted the office but did not make an attack until it was his own day to preside
when the presidency came round to him he arrayed the athenians for battle with the polemarch callimachus commanding the right wing since it was then the athenian custom for the polemarch to hold the right wing he led and the other tribes were numbered out in succession next to each other the plataeans were marshalled last holding the left wing
ever since that battle when the athenians are conducting sacrifices at the festivals every fourth year the athenian herald prays for good things for the athenians and plataeans together
as the athenians were marshalled at marathon it happened that their line of battle was as long as the line of the medes the center where the line was weakest was only a few ranks deep but each wing was strong in numbers
when they had been set in order and the sacrifices were favorable the athenians were sent forth and charged the foreigners at a run the space between the armies was no less than eight stadia
the persians saw them running to attack and prepared to receive them thinking the athenians absolutely crazy since they saw how few of them there were and that they ran up so fast without either cavalry or archers
so the foreigners imagined but when the athenians all together fell upon the foreigners they fought in a way worthy of record these are the first hellenes whom we know of to use running against the enemy they are also the first to endure looking at median dress and men wearing it for up until then just hearing the name of the medes caused the hellenes to panic
they fought a long time at marathon in the center of the line the foreigners prevailed where the persians and sacae were arrayed the foreigners prevailed there and broke through in pursuit inland but on each wing the athenians and plataeans prevailed
in victory they let the routed foreigners flee and brought the wings together to fight those who had broken through the center the athenians prevailed then followed the fleeing persians and struck them down when they reached the sea they demanded fire and laid hold of the persian ships
in this labor callimachus the polemarch was slain a brave man and of the generals stesilaus son of thrasylaus died cynegirus son of euphorion fell there his hand cut off with an ax as he grabbed a ships figurehead many other famous athenians also fell there
in this way the athenians overpowered seven ships the foreigners pushed off with the rest picked up the eretrian slaves from the island where they had left them and sailed around sunium hoping to reach the city before the athenians there was an accusation at athens that they devised this by a plan of the alcmaeonidae who were said to have arranged to hold up a shield as a signal once the persians were in their ships
they sailed around sunium but the athenians marched back to defend the city as fast as their feet could carry them and got there ahead of the foreigners coming from the sacred precinct of heracles in marathon they pitched camp in the sacred precinct of heracles in cynosarges the foreigners lay at anchor off phalerum the athenian naval port at that time after riding anchor there they sailed their ships back to asia
in the battle at marathon about six thousand four hundred men of the foreigners were killed and one hundred and ninetytwo athenians that many fell on each side
the following marvel happened there an athenian epizelus son of couphagoras was fighting as a brave man in the battle when he was deprived of his sight though struck or hit nowhere on his body and from that time on he spent the rest of his life in blindness
i have heard that he tells this story about his misfortune he saw opposing him a tall armed man whose beard overshadowed his shield but the phantom passed him by and killed the man next to him i learned by inquiry that this is the story epizelus tells
datis journeyed with his army to asia and when he arrived at myconos he saw a vision in his sleep what that vision was is not told but as soon as day broke datis made a search of his ships he found in a phoenician ship a gilded image of apollo and asked where this plunder had been taken learning from what temple it had come he sailed in his own ship to delos
the delians had now returned to their island and datis set the image in the temple instructing the delians to carry it away to theban delium on the coast opposite chalcis
datis gave this order and sailed away but the delians never carried that statue away twenty years later the thebans brought it to delium by command of an oracle
when datis and artaphrenes reached asia in their voyage they carried the enslaved eretrians inland to susa
before the eretrians were taken captive king darius had been terribly angry with them for doing him unprovoked wrong but when he saw them brought before him and subject to him he did them no harm but settled them in a domain of his own called ardericca in the cissian land this place is two hundred and ten stadia distant from susa and forty from the well that is of three kinds
asphalt and salt and oil are drawn from it in the following way a windlass is used in the drawing with half a skin tied to it in place of a bucket this is dipped into the well and then poured into a tank then what is drawn is poured into another tank and goes three ways the asphalt and the salt congeal immediately the oil which the persians call rhadinace is dark and evilsmelling
there king darius settled the eretrians and they dwelt in that place until my time keeping their ancient language such was the fate of the eretrians
after the full moon two thousand lacedaemonians came to athens making such great haste to reach it that they were in attica on the third day after leaving sparta although they came too late for the battle they desired to see the medes so they went to marathon and saw them then they departed again praising the athenians and their achievement
it is a wonder to me and i do not believe the story that the alcmeonidae would ever have agreed to hold up a shield as a sign for the persians out of a desire to make athens subject to foreigners and to hippias for it is plain to see that they were tyranthaters as much as callias son of phaenippus and father of hipponicus or even more so
callias was the only athenian who dared to buy pisistratus possessions when they were put up for sale by the state after pisistratus banishment from athens and he devised other acts of bitter hatred against him
this callias is worthy of all mens remembrance for many reasons first because he so excellently freed his country as i have said second for what he did at olympia where he won a horserace and was second in a fourhorse chariot after already winning a pythian prize and was the cynosure of all hellas for the lavishness of his spending
and third for his behavior regarding his three daughters when they were of marriageable age he gave them a most splendid gift and one very pleasant to them promising that each would wed that man whom she chose for herself from all the athenians
the alcmeonidae were tyranthaters as much as callias or not less so therefore i find it a strange and unbelievable accusation that they of all men should have held up a shield at all times they shunned tyrants and it was by their contrivance that the sons of pisistratus were deposed from their tyranny
thus in my judgment it was they who freed athens much more than did harmodius and aristogeiton these only enraged the remaining sons of pisistratus by killing hipparchus and did nothing to end the tyranny of the rest of them but the alcmeonidae plainly liberated their country if they truly were the ones who persuaded the pythian priestess to signify to the lacedaemonians that they should free athens as i have previously shown
perhaps out of some grudge against the athenian people they betrayed their country but there were no others at athens more esteemed or more honored than they
therefore plain reason forbids believing that they of all men could have held up the shield for any such cause a shield was held up this cannot be denied for it happened but who did it i do not know and i can say no further
the alcmeonidae had been men of renown at athens even in the old days and from the time of alcmeon and then megacles their renown increased
when the lydians from sardis came from croesus to the delphic oracle alcmeon son of megacles worked with them and zealously aided them when croesus heard from the lydians who visited the oracle of alcmeons benefits to him he summoned alcmeon to sardis and there made him a gift of as much gold as he could carry away at one time on his person
considering the nature of the gift alcmeon planned and employed this device he donned a wide tunic leaving a deep fold in it and put on the most spacious boots that he could find then went into the treasury to which they led him
falling upon a heap of golddust first he packed next to his legs as much gold as his boots would contain then he filled all the fold of his tunic with gold and strewed the dust among the hair of his head and took more of it into his mouth when he came out of the treasury hardly dragging the weight of his boots he was like anything rather than a human being with his mouth crammed full and all his body swollen
croesus burst out laughing at the sight and gave him all the gold he already had and that much more again thus the family grew very rich alcmeon came to keep fourhorse chariots and won with them at olympia
in the next generation cleisthenes the tyrant of sicyon raised that house still higher so that it grew much more famous in hellas than it had formerly been cleisthenes son of aristonymus son of myron son of andreas had one daughter whose name was agariste he desired to wed her to the best man he could find in hellas
it was the time of the olympian games and when he was victor there with a fourhorse chariot cleisthenes made a proclamation that whichever greek thought himself worthy to be his soninlaw should come on the sixtieth day from then or earlier to sicyon and cleisthenes would make good his promise of marriage in a year from that sixtieth day
then all the greeks who were proud of themselves and their country came as suitors and to that end cleisthenes had them compete in running and wrestling contests
from italy came smindyrides of sybaris son of hippocrates the most luxurious liver of his day and sybaris was then at the height of its prosperity and damasus of siris son of that amyris who was called the wise
these came from italy from the ionian gulf amphimnestus son of epistrophus an epidamnian he was from the ionian gulf from aetolia came males the brother of that titormus who surpassed all the greeks in strength and fled from the sight of men to the farthest parts of the aetolian land
from the peloponnese came leocedes son of phidon the tyrant of argos that phidon who made weights and measures for the peloponnesians and acted more arrogantly than any other greek he drove out the elean contestdirectors and held the contests at olympia himself this mans son now came and amiantus an arcadian from trapezus son of lycurgus and an azenian from the town of paeus laphanes son of that euphorion who as the arcadian tale relates gave lodging to the dioscuri and ever since kept open house for all men and onomastus from elis son of agaeus
these came from the peloponnese itself from athens megacles son of that alcmeon who visited croesus and also hippocleides son of tisandrus who surpassed the athenians in wealth and looks from eretria which at that time was prosperous came lysanias he was the only man from euboea from thessaly came a scopad diactorides of crannon and from the molossians alcon
these were the suitors when they arrived on the appointed day cleisthenes first inquired the country and lineage of each then he kept them with him for a year testing their manliness and temper and upbringing and manner of life this he did by consorting with them alone and in company putting the younger of them to contests of strength but especially watching their demeanor at the common meal for as long as he kept them with him he did everything for them and entertained them with magnificence
the suitors that most pleased him were the ones who had come from athens and of these hippocleides son of tisandrus was judged foremost both for his manliness and because in ancestry he was related to the cypselids of corinth
when the appointed day came for the marriage feast and for cleisthenes declaration of whom he had chosen out of them all cleisthenes sacrificed a hundred oxen and gave a feast to the suitors and to the whole of sicyon
after dinner the suitors vied with each other in music and in anecdotes for all to hear as they sat late drinking hippocleides now far outdoing the rest ordered the fluteplayer to play him a dancetune the fluteplayer obeyed and he began to dance i suppose he pleased himself with his dancing but cleisthenes saw the whole business with much disfavor
hippocleides then stopped for a while and ordered a table to be brought in when the table arrived he danced laconian figures on it first and then attic last of all he rested his head on the table and made gestures with his legs in the air
now cleisthenes at the first and the second bout of dancing could no more bear to think of hippocleides as his soninlaw because of his dancing and his shamelessness but he had held himself in check not wanting to explode at hippocleides but when he saw him making gestures with his legs he could no longer keep silence and said son of tisandrus you have danced away your marriage hippocleides said in answer it does not matter to hippocleides since then this is proverbial
then cleisthenes bade them all be silent and spoke to the company at large suitors for my daughters hand i thank you one and all if it were possible i would grant each of you his wish neither choosing out one to set him above another nor disparaging the rest
but since i have but one maiden to plan for and so cannot please all of you to those of you whose suit is rejected i make a gift of a talent of silver to each for his desire to take a wife from my house and for his sojourn away from his home and to megacles son of alcmeon do i betroth my daughter agariste by the laws of the athenians megacles accepted the betrothal and cleisthenes brought the marriage to pass
such is the tale of the choice among the suitors and thus the fame of the alcmeonidae resounded throughout hellas from this marriage was born that cleisthenes named after his mothers father from sicyon who gave the athenians their tribes and their democracy
he and hippocrates were born to megacles hippocrates was father of another megacles and another agariste called after agariste who was cleisthenes daughter she was married to xanthippus son of ariphron and when she was pregnant she saw in her sleep a vision in which she thought she gave birth to a lion in a few days she bore xanthippus a son pericles
after the persian disaster at marathon the reputation of miltiades already great at athens very much increased he asked the athenians for seventy ships an army and money not revealing against what country he would lead them but saying that he would make them rich if they followed him he would bring them to a country from which they could easily carry away an abundance of gold so he said when he asked for the ships the athenians were induced by these promises and granted his request
miltiades took his army and sailed for paros on the pretext that the parians had brought this on themselves by first sending triremes with the persian fleet to marathon such was the pretext of his argument but he had a grudge against the parians because lysagoras son of tisias a man of parian descent had slandered him to hydarnes the persian
when he reached his voyages destination miltiades with his army drove the parians inside their walls and besieged them he sent in a herald and demanded a hundred talents saying that if they did not give it to him his army would not return home before it had stormed their city
the parians had no intention of giving miltiades any money at all and they contrived how to defend their city they did this by building their wall at night to double its former height where it was most assailable and also by other devices
all the greeks tell the same story up to this point after this the parians themselves say that the following happened as miltiades was in a quandary a captive woman named timo parian by birth and an underpriestess of the goddesses of the dead came to talk with him
coming before miltiades she advised him if taking paros was very important to him to do whatever she suggested then following her advice he passed through to the hill in front of the city and jumped over the fence of the precinct of demeter the lawgiver since he was unable to open the door after leaping over he went to the shrine whether to move something that should not be moved or with some other intention when he was right at the doors he was immediately seized with panic and hurried back by the same route leaping down from the wall he twisted his thigh but some say he hit his knee
so miltiades sailed back home in a sorry condition neither bringing money for the athenians nor having won paros he had besieged the town for twentysix days and ravaged the island
the parians learned that timo the underpriestess of the goddesses had been miltiades guide and desired to punish her for this since they now had respite from the siege they sent messengers to delphi to ask if they should put the underpriestess to death for guiding their enemies to the capture of her native country and for revealing to miltiades the rites that no male should know
but the pythian priestess forbade them saying that timo was not responsible miltiades was doomed to make a bad end and an apparition had led him in these evils
such was the priestess reply to the parians the athenians had much to say about miltiades on his return from paros especially xanthippus son of ariphron who prosecuted miltiades before the people for deceiving the athenians and called for the death penalty
miltiades was present but could not speak in his own defense since his thigh was festering he was laid before the court on a couch and his friends spoke for him often mentioning the fight at marathon and the conquest of lemnos how miltiades had punished the pelasgians and taken lemnos delivering it to the athenians
the people took his side as far as not condemning him to death but they fined him fifty talents for his wrongdoing miltiades later died of gangrene and rot in his thigh and the fifty talents were paid by his son cimon
miltiades son of cimon took possession of lemnos in this way when the pelasgians were driven out of attica by the athenians whether justly or unjustly i cannot say beyond what is told namely that hecataeus the son of hegesandrus declares in his history that the act was unjust
for when the athenians saw the land under hymettus formerly theirs which they had given to the pelasgians as a dwellingplace in reward for the wall that had once been built around the acropolis when the athenians saw how well this place was tilled which previously had been bad and worthless they were envious and coveted the land and so drove the pelasgians out on this and no other pretext but the athenians themselves say that their reason for expelling the pelasgians was just
the pelasgians set out from their settlement at the foot of hymettus and wronged the athenians in this way neither the athenians nor any other hellenes had servants yet at that time and their sons and daughters used to go to the nine wells for water and whenever they came the pelasgians maltreated them out of mere arrogance and pride and this was not enough for them finally they were caught in the act of planning to attack athens
the athenians were much better men than the pelasgians since when they could have killed them caught plotting as they were they would not so do but ordered them out of the country the pelasgians departed and took possession of lemnos besides other places this is the athenian story the other is told by hecataeus
these pelasgians dwelt at that time in lemnos and desired vengeance on the athenians since they well knew the time of the athenian festivals they acquired fiftyoared ships and set an ambush for the athenian women celebrating the festival of artemis at brauron they seized many of the women then sailed away with them and brought them to lemnos to be their concubines
these women bore more and more children and they taught their sons the speech of attica and athenian manners these boys would not mix with the sons of the pelasgian women if one of them was beaten by one of the others they would all run to his aid and help each other these boys even claimed to rule the others and were much stronger
when the pelasgians perceived this they took counsel together it troubled them much in their deliberations to think what the boys would do when they grew to manhood if they were resolved to help each other against the sons of the lawful wives and attempted to rule them already
thereupon the pelasgians resolved to kill the sons of the attic women they did this and then killed the boys mothers also from this deed and the earlier one which was done by the women when they killed their own husbands who were thoas companions a lemnian crime has been a proverb in hellas for any deed of cruelty
but when the pelasgians had murdered their own sons and women their land brought forth no fruit nor did their wives and their flocks and herds bear offspring as before crushed by hunger and childlessness they sent to delphi to ask for some release from their present ills
the pythian priestess ordered them to pay the athenians whatever penalty the athenians themselves judged the pelasgians went to athens and offered to pay the penalty for all their wrongdoing
the athenians set in their townhall a couch adorned as finely as possible and placed beside it a table covered with all manner of good things then ordered the pelasgians to deliver their land to them in the same condition
the pelasgians answered we will deliver it when a ship with a north wind accomplishes the voyage from your country to ours in one day they supposed that this was impossible since attica is far to the south of lemnos
at the time that was all but a great many years later when the chersonese on the hellespont was made subject to athens miltiades son of cimon accomplished the voyage from elaeus on the chersonese to lemnos with the etesian winds then constantly blowing he proclaimed that the pelasgians must leave their island reminding them of the oracle which the pelasgians thought would never be fulfilled
the hephaestians obeyed but the myrinaeans would not agree that the chersonese was attica and were besieged until they too submitted thus did miltiades and the athenians take possession of lemnos
