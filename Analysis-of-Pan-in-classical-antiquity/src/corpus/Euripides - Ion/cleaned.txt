before the temple of apollo at delphi the sun is about to rise hermes enters
hermes
hermes
atlas who wears away heaven the ancient home of the gods on his bronze shoulders was the father of maia by a goddess she bore me hermes to great zeus and i am the gods servant
i have come to delphi this land where phoebus from his central throne chants to mortals always declaring the present and the future
for hellas has a famous city which received its name from pallas of the golden lance
here apollo forced a union on creusa the child of erechtheus where the rocks turned to the north beneath the hill of pallas athenian land are called macrai by the lords of attica unknown to her father  such was the pleasure of the god
she bore the weight in her womb when the time came creusa gave birth in the house to a child and brought the infant to the same cave where the god had bedded her and there exposed him to die in the round circle of a hollow cradle
observant of the customs of her ancestors and of erichthonius the earthborn for the daughter of zeus set beside him two serpents to guard his body and gave him in charge to the daughters of aglauros
from which the erechthidae have a custom to rear their children in gold serpents ornaments which the girl had she hung around her son and left him to die and phoebus as my brother asked me this o brother go to the nativeborn people
of glorious athens for you know the city of the goddess take the newborn baby from the hollow rock with his cradle and babyclothes bring him to my shrine at delphi and place him at the very entrance of my temple
the rest know that the child is mine will be my care to gratify my brother loxias i took up the woven basket and brought it here and placed the boy at the base of this temple
opening up the wreathed cradle so that the infant might be seen
it happened that as the sun rose the priestess entered the gods prophetic shrine she saw the baby and marvelled that some girl of delphi had dared
to cast her secret child into the house of the god she was eager to take it away from the shrine but she let the harsh intent gave way to pity and the god worked with her so the child might not be hurled out of his house she took up the child and raised it
she did not know that phoebus was the father nor who the mother was nor did the child know about his parents
when young he played round the shrine and was nourished there but when he grew to manhood the delphians made him guardian of the gods treasures
a trusted steward of all and here in the temple of the god he has lived a holy life but creusa the mother of the child married xuthus in these circumstances a wave of war came over athens and the chalcidians
who hold the land of euboea he joined their efforts and with them drove out the enemy by his spear for this he received the honor of marriage with creusa he was no native but born an achaean from aeolus the son of zeus though married a long time
they are childless so they have come to this oracular shrine of phoebus in longing for a child loxias is driving fortune on to this point nor is he forgetful as he seems for he will give his child to xuthus on entering this shrine
and he will say the boy was born from xuthus so that creusa may recognize the child when he comes to her house and phoebus union with her may be kept secret and the boy have his due he will cause him founder of the land of asia
to be called by the name of ion throughout greece but i will go to this cave of laurels so that i may learn what is fated for the child i see this son of loxias coming out to adorn the gates before the shrine with laurel boughs
i am the first of the gods to give him that name ion which he is about to havehermes vanishes ion and the attendants of the temple enter
ion
already this radiant fourhorse chariot the sun flames over the earth and at this fire of heaven the stars
flee into the sacred night the untrod parnassian cliffs shining receive the wheel of day for mortals the smoke of dry myrtle flies to phoebus roof
the woman of delphi  sits on the sacred tripod and sings out to the hellenes whatever apollo cries to her but you delphian servants of phoebus
go to the silver whirlpools of castalia come to the temple when you have bathed in its pure waters it is good to keep your mouth holy in speech and give good words from your lips
to those who wish to consult the oracle but i will labor at the task that has been mine from childhood with laurel boughs and sacred wreaths making pure the entrance to phoebus temple
and the ground moist with drops of water and with my bow i will chase the crowds of birds that harm the holy offerings for as i was born without a mother and a father
i serve the temple of phoebus that nurtured methe attendants leave ion busies himself before the temple as he continues to sing
ion
come newgrown ministering bough of loveliest laurel you who sweep the altar
under the temple of apollo you are from the immortal gardens where the secred drops water the holy foliage of myrtle
sending forth an everflowing stream with this laurel i sweep the pavement of the god all day along with the suns swift wing my daily service
o paean o paean may you be fortunate child of leto
ion
lovely is the labor o phoebus i carry out for you before your house
honoring your prophetic shrine glorious my labor to be a slave for gods not mortal but immortal i do not tire
of laboring over my auspicious work phoebus is a father to me i praise the one who feeds me the name of father beneficial to me i give to
phoebus who rules this temple o paean o paean may you be fortunate child of leto
ion
but i will cease from labor
with the laurel branch and i wil hurl from golden vases gaias fountain which castalias eddies pour out casting out the moist drops
since i am chaste may i never cease to serve phoebus in this manner or if i do may it be with good fortune ah ah already the birds of parnassus have left their nests
and come here i forbid you to approach the walls and the golden house i will reach you with my bow herald of zeus though you conquer
with your beak the strength of all other birds here comes another a swan to the rim of the temple move your crimson foot elsewhere phoebus lyre that sings with you
would not protect you from my bow alter your wings course go to the delian lake if you do not obey you will steep your lovely melody in blood
ah ah what is this new bird that approaches you will not place under the cornice a strawbuilt nest for your children will you my singing bow will keep you off will you not obey
go away and bring up your offspring by the eddies of alpheus or go to the isthmian grove so that the offerings and the temple of phoebus are not harmed     and yet i am ashamed to kill you
for to mortals you bear the messages of the gods but i will be subject to phoebus in my appointed tasks and i will never cease my service to those who nourish me
the chorus enters
chorus
not only in our holy athens
are there halls of the gods with beautiful columns and worship of apollo who guards the streets but also in the house of loxias letos son there is a light of two countenances with lovely eyes
look come see the son of zeus is killing the lernean hydra with a golden sickle my dear look at it
chorus
i see it and another near him
who is raising a fiery torch  is he the one whose story is told when i am at my loom the warrior iolaus
who joins with the son of zeus in bearing his labors
and look at this one sitting on a winged horse he is killing the mighty firebreathing creature that has three bodies
chorus
i am glancing around everywhere see the battle of the giants on the stone walls
i am looking at it my friends
do you see the one
brandishing her gorgon shield against enceladus
i see pallas my own goddess
now what the mighty thunderbolt blazing at both ends in the farshooting hands of zeus
i see it
he is burning the furious mimas to ashes in the fire
and bacchus the roarer is killing another of the sons of earth with his ivy staff unfit for war
chorus
you there i mean the one by the temple
is it lawful to walk into the sanctuary
ion
strangers it is not lawful
chorus
may we ask you something
ion
what do you want to know
chorus
does the temple of phoebus really hold the center of the earth
ion
yes adorned with garlands and gorgons all around
chorus
so fame reports
ion
if you offer the honey cake before the temple and you wish to ask something of phoebus advance to the altar before the sheep have been sacrificed do not approach the recesses of the temple
chorus
i understand i do not wish to transgress
the gods law what is outside delights my eyes
ion
take a full view of everything that is allowed
chorus
my masters allowed me to to look at this sanctuary
ion
you are the slaves of what house
chorus
the temple of pallas is the house that reared my sovereigns but the one you ask about is here
creusa and attendants enter
ion
there is nobility in you and you have an appearance that is a witness to your character lady whoever you are for most men at least you would know from their appearance if they are wellborn
ah you amaze me that you closed your eyes and watered your noble cheeks with tears when you saw the holy oracle of loxias why are you sorrowful lady
does that which pleases all others who see the sanctuary of the god bring tears to your eyes here
creusa
o stranger it is not foolish of you to wonder at my tears when i saw apollos halls
i recalled an ancient memory i suppose that my mind was at home though i am present here o unhappy women o gods what deeds are yours what then to what may we ascribe justice if we are destroyed by the injustice of those in power
ion
what inexplicable thing grieves you lady
creusa
nothing i have shot my arrow now i am silent do not concern yourself further
ion
who are you from what land have you come what country is your fatherland by what name should we call you
creusa
creusa is my name  erechtheus my father the city of athens my fatherland
ion
o you that dwell in a famous city and were brought up by noble parents how i marvel at you lady
creusa
i am fortunate so far stranger and no further
ion
by the gods truly as the tale goes among mortals
creusa
what are you asking about stranger that you want to know
ion
your fathers ancestor grew from the earth
creusa
yes erichthonius but my family is no benefit to me
ion
and did athena take him up from the earth
creusa
into her virgin hands she was not his mother
ion
and gave him as paintings usually show
creusa
to the daughters of kekrops to keep unseen
ion
i have heard that the maidens opened the vessel of the goddess
creusa
and so they died making the promontory of the rock bloody
ion
i see well what about this is it true or a vain rumor
creusa
what are you asking for i am at leisure
ion
did your father erechtheus sacrifice your sisters
creusa
he dared to kill the maidens as a sacrifice for their country
ion
and you were the only one of your sisters saved
creusa
i was a newborn infant in my mothers arms
ion
did a hollow of the earth truly hide your father
creusa
the blows of the seagods trident destroyed him
ion
there is a place there called makrai
creusa
why do you ask this how you have reminded me of something
ion
phoebus and the pythian lightning honor it
creusa
would that i had never seen it
ion
why do you hate the place very dear to the god
creusa
no reason i know of a shameful deed in a cave
ion
but what athenian married you lady
creusa
no citizen but a foreigner from another land
ion
who he must be someone of noble birth
creusa
xuthus born from aeolus and zeus
ion
and how as a stranger did he have you a citizen
creusa
there is a city euboea which is a neighbor to athens
ion
divided by a watery boundary they say
creusa
he destroyed it in common battle with the athenians
ion
he came as an ally and then he married you
creusa
taking me as the dowry of war and the prize of his spear
ion
have you come to the oracle with your husband or alone
creusa
with him he turned aside to the shrine of trophonius
ion
to view it or for the sake of prophecy
creusa
he wishes to learn one word from that shrine and from phoebus
ion
have you come for the sake of harvests or for children
creusa
we are without children though married a long time
ion
you have never borne a child but you are childless
creusa
phoebus knows about my lack of children
ion
unhappy one that you are fortunate in all else but not in this
creusa
but who are you how i call your mother happy
ion
i am called the slave of the god lady
creusa
a citys offering or sold by someone
ion
i only know this i am called loxias
creusa
then in turn stranger i pity you
ion
because i do not know my mother or my ancestors
creusa
do you live in this temple or in a house
ion
the whole home of the god is mine wherever i may sleep
creusa
were you a child when you came to the shrine or a youth
ion
those who seem to know say that i was an infant
creusa
and which delphian woman nourished you with milk
ion
i never knew the breast the one who brought me up
creusa
who sorrowful one i have found an ailment like my own
ion
the priestess of apollo i consider her my mother
creusa
with whose support have you have come to manhood
ion
the altars have fed me and any strangers that come here
creusa
your mother is unhappy who was she then
ion
perhaps my birth is some womans wrong
creusa
but you have a livelihood for you are well dressed
ion
i am adorned with these by the god whom i serve
creusa
you have not been eager to search for your family
ion
i have no token of proof lady
creusa
alas another woman has suffered as your mother did
ion
who if she could assist my troubles i would be delighted
creusa
one for whose sake i have come here before my husband
ion
what do you want so that i may help you lady
creusa
i want to learn a secret oracle from pheobus
ion
tell me i shall be your sponsor for the rest
creusa
then hear the story but shame prevents me
ion
then you will accomplish nothing that goddess is an idle one
creusa
one of my friends says that she had intercourse with apollo
ion
a woman with apollo do not say that stranger
creusa
and she bore a child to the god without her fathers knowledge
ion
it is not so she is ashamed of a mans wrong
creusa
she says not and the wretched woman has suffered
ion
what did she do to suffer if she was coupled with the god
creusa
she exposed out of doors the child that she bore
ion
where is the exposed child is it alive
creusa
no one knowsthis is what i am asking the oracle
ion
if it is no longer alive how was it destroyed
creusa
she expects that wild animals killed the unfortunate one
ion
by what sign did she know this
creusa
when she came to the place where she had exposed him she could no longer find him
ion
was there a drop of blood in the path
creusa
she says not although she went back and forth over much ground
ion
how much time has passed since the child was killed
creusa
if he were indeed alive he would be your age
ion
the god has wronged him the mother is unhappy
creusa
she did not bear any other child afterwards
ion
what if phoebus took him and brought him up in secret
creusa
he does wrong to enjoy a common pleasure alone
ion
alas this misfortune is in accord with my sorrow
creusa
stranger i think an unhappy mother longs for you also
ion
do not draw me to griefs that i have forgotten
creusa
i am silent can you fulfil what i am asking you about
ion
do you know what part of your enquiry is especially ailing
creusa
what is not diseased for that wretched woman
ion
how shall the god prophesy what he wants to hide
creusa
he will if he is indeed seated on the public tripod of hellas
ion
he is ashamed of the deed do not convict him
creusa
but the one who suffered this misfortune is in pain
ion
there is no one who will be your interpreter
if phoebus appeared evil in his own home he would rightly do some harm to the one who gave you the oracle cease this lady there must be no consultation contrary to the god for we would come to such folly as that
if we shall work on the gods to say what they are not willing to say either by sacrifice of sheep at the altar or through the flight of birds for what we violently strive after when the gods are unwilling we possess as unwilling goods lady
whatever they give willingly is a benefit to us
chorus leader
there are many misfortunes for many mortals and their shapes are various one could scarcely ever find one piece of good fortune in mans life
creusa
o phoebus you are not just to her either there or here
though she is absent her words are presentyou did not save your child whom you ought to have saved nor though a prophet will you speak to the mother who is asking you so that if he is no more he may be honored by a tomb but if he lives
but i must let this go if i am prevented by the god from learning what i wish
but stranger since i see my noble husband xuthus has left the cave of trophonius and is near
be silent before him about our conversation so that i may not be disgraced by my secret ministry and the talk may not go where i have not unfolded it to him for women have difficulties with their husbands and we are hated the good women being mingled with the bad
so unfortunate were we born
xuthus and his retinue enter
xuthus
first may the god rejoice when he has the firstfruits of my addresses and then you lady you werent afraid at my long absence were you
creusa
no you have come upon my anxiety but
tell me what oracle do you bring from trophonius about the begetting of children
xuthus
he did not think it right to anticipate the answer of the god but he said one thing that neither you nor i would go home from the oracle childless
creusa
o revered lady mother of phoebus may we have come here auspiciously and may our former engagements with your son fall out better
xuthus
it shall be so but who is the interpreter of the god
ion
i am outside within it belongs to others
seated near the tripod stranger the best men of delphi chosen by lot
xuthus
good i have everything i need i will go inside for as i hear the victim has been sacrificed for foreigners
in common before the shrine i want on this day for it is propitious to receive the answer of the god but you lady take these laurel twigs around the altars and pray to the gods for me to bring from apollos temple oracles that give hope of childrenxuthus after giving the laurel boughs to creusa enters the temple
creusa
it shall be so it shall if phoebus is even now willing to redress his earlier wrong he would not be wholly dear to me yet i will accept what he foretells for us as he is a godcreusa departs to the shrines in the outer precinct of the temple
ion
why is the stranger always making abusive riddles
in obscure words against the god is it because she loves the one for whom she is consulting the oracle or is she being silent about something that she must conceal but what is the daughter of erechtheus to me it is not my concern i will go
and pour water from golden pitchers into the sacred vessels but i must give apollo some advice what is he about does he betray virgins by forced rape does he secretly breed children and leave them to die do not do so but since you have power
seek after virtue for if any mortal is bad the gods punish him how then is it just for you to write laws for mortals and yourselves incur a charge of lawlessness if for it is not so but i will handle the subject
you pay the penalty to mortals for rape you and poseidon and zeus who rules heaven you will empty your temples paying for your crimes for you do wrong to go eagerly after your pleasures without thinking no longer is it right
to speak badly of men if we imitate what the gods think good but rather of the ones who taught us these thingsion goes out
chorus
you who were born without the pains of childbirth my athena i beseech you brought to birth by the
titan prometheus from the crown of zeuss head o blessed victory come to the pythian home from the golden chambers of olympus
flying to the ways where phoebus hearth in the middle of the earth fulfils oracles at the tripod celebrated with dances
you and the daughter of leto two goddesses two virgins the holy sisters of apollo maidens beseech that the ancient race of erechtheus
may find clear oracles of longdelayed birth of children
chorus
for it is an immoveable security of overpowering happiness for mortals
when the youthful strength of children who will bear fruit in their turn shines in the fathers halls and they will have inherited wealth from their fathers
in the form of other children for it brings a cure in ills pleasure in good fortune a saving defense with the spear for ones native land for me the careful nurture of dear children
would be beyond wealth and a kings palace i hate the childless life and i blame the one to whom it seems good
may i have a life blessed with children and moderate wealth
chorus
o seats of pan and rocks that lie near the hollows of makrai
where the three daughters of aglauros dance over the green courses before the temples of pallas to the quavering wail of pipes of songs
when you play the pipes in your sunless caves o pan where an unhappy maiden bore a child to phoebus and exposed it as a feast for birds
and a bloody banquet for wild beasts the outrage of the bitter rape neither at the loom nor in speeches have i heard that the children born to mortals from gods claim a report of good fortune
ion reenters
ion
servant women that keep your station around this incensebreathing temples base and watch for your mistress has xuthus already left the sacred tripod and oracle or is he remaining in the shrine to ask about his childlessness
chorus leader
he is in the temple stranger he has not yet left this house
but he is in the passageway i hear the sound of the doors and now i can see the master coming out
xuthus enters from the temple he rushes to greet ion
xuthus
my boy welcome that is a suitable way to begin speaking
ion
i am well as long as you stay in your right mind we are both doing well
xuthus
let me kiss your hand and throw my arms around your body
ion
are you in your right mind stranger or has some damage from a god driven you mad
xuthus
i am sane since i have found my dearest i long for him not to escape
ion
stop do not break by your touch the garlands of the god
xuthus
i will touch i am not seizing you as a pledge but i have found my own
ion
wont you stop before you get an arrow in your side
xuthus
why do you try to escape from me
when you have met your own dearest
ion
i do not like to teach rude and maddened strangers
xuthus
kill me and raise my funeral pyre but if you kill me you will be the murderer of your father
ion
how are you my father isnt this a joke on me
xuthus
no the story as it goes on will make clear my words to you
ion
and what will you tell me
xuthus
i am your father and you are my child
ion
who declares this
xuthus
loxias who nurtured you although you were mine
ion
you are your own witness
xuthus
informed by the oracle of the god
ion
you went astray when you heard a riddle
xuthus
then i cant hear properly
ion
what were the words of phoebus
xuthus
that the one who met me
ion
what meeting
xuthus
as i came out of the temple
ion
what would be the result
xuthus
that he would be my son
ion
born your son or a gift from some other
xuthus
a gift but born my son
ion
and did you first meet me
xuthus
no one else my son
ion
however did this happen
xuthus
the two of us marvel at the one event
ion
ah but who is my mother
xuthus
that i cannot say
ion
phoebus did not tell you
xuthus
i was pleased at this and did not ask him that
ion
then perhaps i was born from mother earth
xuthus
the earth bears no children
ion
well how could i be yours
xuthus
i do not know i refer it to the god
ion
let us touch on some other topic
xuthus
this one is better my child
ion
have you gone to an unlawful bed
xuthus
yes in the folly of youth
ion
was that before your marriage with the daughter of erechtheus
xuthus
yes never afterwards
ion
so did you beget me then
xuthus
the time agrees
ion
then how did i arrive here
xuthus
i cannot account for that
ion
coming a long way
xuthus
that perplexes me also
ion
have you come to the pythian rock before
xuthus
to the torchprocessions of bacchus
ion
you stayed with one of the public hosts
xuthus
he with the girls of delphi
ion
brought you into their company or what are you saying
xuthus
the maenads of bacchus
ion
were you sensible or under the influence
xuthus
in the pleasures of bacchus
ion
it was then that i was conceived
xuthus
fate has discovered you my son
ion
how did i come to the temple then
xuthus
perhaps you were exposed by the girl
ion
i have escaped from slavery
xuthus
now receive your father
ion
it is reasonable not to distrust the god at any rate
xuthus
now you are in your right mind
ion
and what else do i want
xuthus
now you are seeing what you ought to see
ion
than to be the son of zeus son
xuthus
which is yours
ion
am i really touching the one who gave me birth
xuthus
if you trust in the god
ion
welcome father
xuthus
what a sweet word to hear
ion
this present day
xuthus
has made me happy
ion
my dear mother when shall i see you also now i long to see you whoever you are more than before
but perhaps you are dead and it could never happen
chorus leader
we feel the good fortune of the house in common with you yet i wish that my mistress too and the race of erechtheus were happy in children
xuthus
my son the god has rightly brought about your discovery
and joined you to me and you in turn have found your closest relationship which you had not known before and what you are rightly eager for is also my desire that you my boy may find your mother and i may find the woman who bore you to me
if we leave it to time perhaps we may discover it but abandon the gods precinct and your service of him and come to athens in agreement with your father where his scepter awaits you and abundant wealth although you suffer from one of these two conditions
you will not be called illborn and poor but wellborn and rich you are silent why do you cast your eyes down to the earth you have gone into deep thought and your change from joy frightens your father
ion
ion
matters do not have the same appearance from far off as when seen close up i welcome my fortune finding my father in you but hear father what i have in mind it is said that the famous athenians are natives of the land
not a foreign race so that i shall burst in on them with two ailments my father a foreigner and myself of bastard birth and with this reproach if i am insignificant i shall be called no one and nothing
if i rush into the highest rank of the city and seek to be someone i will be hated by the powerless those above them are troublesome to them those who are good and able to be wise keep silent and are not eager for public affairs
to them i will seem laughable and foolish if i am not at rest in a city full of fear if i attain the reputation of those who are    and useful in the city the more i will be guarded against in the votes it is likely to be this way father
those who hold cities and high rank are most hostile to their rivals
and if i come to a strange house as a foreigner to a childless woman who shared that misfortune with you before and now has it as her own lot
and will feel it bitterly how will she not hate me and with reason whenever i stand beside you but she the childless one looks bitterly on your darling and then either you must forsake me looking to your wife
or honor me and throw your house into confusion how much slaughter and destruction by poisoning have women found out for men besides i pity your wife father growing old without a child for she is not worthy
being of a noble line to have this misery
the outward face of royalty falsely praised  is sweet but there is bitterness in the home for who is happy or fortunate who draws out his life in fear and sidelong glances
i would rather live as a fortunate citizen than as a king for whom it is a pleasure to have wicked friends and hate the virtuous through fear of death you might say that gold overcomes these things
and riches give delight i do not like to hear the noise of the crowd while i guard my wealth at hand nor to have troubles i would rather have moderation free of care
listen to the blessings i have here father first the dearest to mortals leisure and
moderate trouble no worthless creature has struck me out of the way this is not to be borne to give way and yield to road to the base in prayers to the gods or    of men i would serve those who rejoiced not those who lamented
and some i would send away while others would come as guests so that i was always a pleasant novelty among the new arrivals and what men ought to wish for even if they are unwilling custom and my nature made me righteous before the god with these things in mind
i think it better here than there father let me live here for the pleasure is equal to rejoice in greatness or to have delight with little
chorus leader
you have spoken well if those whom i love are fortunate in what you love
xuthus
no more of these words learn how to be successful i wish to begin where i found you my son with a public table providing a general feast and to hold the sacrifices which i did not make at your birth and now i will bring you as a guest at my table and cheer you with the banquet
then lead you to athens as a pretended visitor not as my son for i do not want to grieve my wife who is childless while i am fortunate  i will seize the right occasion and induce my wife
to let you hold the scepter of the land together with me ion i name you as befits your fortune since you were the first to meet me as i came out ot the gods shrine but assemble a full number of your friends greet them at the sacrifice with pleasure
since you will soon leave the city of delphi and you slaves i tell you to be silent on these matters or it will be death for those that tell my wife
ion
i will go but one part of my fortune is lacking if i do not find my mother
my life will not be endurable father if it is right to pray for it my mother would be an athenian so that from her i might have freedom to speak my mind for one who bursts as a stranger into a city unmixed in race even if he is called a citizen
must keep a slavish mouth closed and does not feel free to speak
xuthus and ion go out
chorus
i see tears and mournful cries and attacks of groaning when my queen knows that her husband is blessed with a child
while she is childless and deprived of children what prophecy have you sung oracular child of leto from where did this boy nourished at your shrine step forth what woman is his mother
the oracle does not please me there may be treachery in it i fear what is to come from this chance
it is strange and brings strange events to me but the boy keeps the rest silent treachery and fate     brought up from anothers blood who will not agree to this
chorus
my friends shall we cry out these things clearly to the ears of our mistress her husband with whom she shared all her hopes unhappy woman    now her fortunes are ruined while he is successful
she has fallen into a gray old age but her husband does not honor his friends wretched one who came to her home an outsider to great prosperity and did not put her on a level with his fortunes may he perish perish deceiving my mistress
and may he not succeed when he offers to the gods the brightly burning sacrifice on the fire but he will know my mind how friendly i am
to my queen now the new father and son are approaching the new dinner
chorus
o ridge of parnassus
holding the high rock and seat of heaven where bacchus with flaming torches leaps lightly with the bacchantes that roam by night  may the boy never come to my city
may he leave his young life and die for the mourning city would have for excuse a foreign invasion        the former king lord erechtheus gathered his forces
creusa and her aged tutor enter
creusa
old tutor of my father erechtheus while he was alive come up to the oracular seat so that you may rejoice with me if lord loxias has spoken any oracle on begetting of children
for it is sweet to have good fortune in the presence of friends if things should go badly may they not it is pleasant to look in the face of someone kind though i am your mistress i tend you as a father as once you tended my father
tutor

creusa

tutor
i am my foot is slow but my mind is quick
creusa

tutor
that is blind also whenever my sight is dim
creusa
well said but do not give way to weariness
tutor
i am willing but i have no power over my absent strength
creusa
women trusted servants of my loom and shuttle what fortune did my husband take away concerning children for which we came here
if good inform me you will be doing a favor for masters that can be trusted
chorus leader
sung
o fortune
tutor
the prelude of your speech is not prosperous
chorus leader
sung
o unhappy
tutor
but why do oracles given to my masters afflict me
chorus leader
well what should we do there is death in these matters
creusa
what is this eloquence what are you afraid of
chorus leader
shall we speak or be silent or what shall we do
creusa
speak you have some misfortune for me
chorus leader
it shall be spoken even if i were to die twice it is not for you mistress ever to hold a child in your arms or clasp it to your breast
creusa
sung
alas i wish i were dead
tutor
sung
my daughter
creusa

o unhappy in my fate i have received i have suffered an unbearable pain my friends
i am wholly ruined
tutor
sung
my child
creusa
sung
alas a piercing grief has struck me in my heart
tutor
do not groan yet
creusa
sung
but the mourning is already here
tutor
until we learn
creusa
sung
what message for me
tutor
if the master has a share in this same fate or you alone are unfortunate
chorus leader
to him old man loxias has given a son
and he is fortunate by himself apart from her
creusa
sung
you have cried out this evil upon that the height of grief for me to mourn
tutor
will he have to breed the child you speak of from some other woman or did the god declare one already born
chorus leader
loxias gave him a youth already full grown i was present
creusa
sung
what are you saying your words are amazing to me unspeakable
tutor
and to me how is this oracle to be fulfilled tell me most clearly who the boy is
chorus leader
the god gave him as a son the one whom he should first encounter when he rushed away from the god
creusa
sung
oh oh has he then sung out
my childless childless life i shall live in a bereaved house in loneliness
tutor
who was proclaimed whom did the husband of this unhappy woman encounter how and where did he see him
chorus leader
do you my dear mistress know the youth
that was sweeping this temple that is the boy
creusa
sung
if only i might fly up to the soft sky far from the land of hellas the western stars such pain have i suffered my friends
tutor
what name did his father give him do you know or does it remain unratified in silence
chorus leader
ion since he was the first to meet his father
tutor
and who was his mother
chorus leader
i can not say her husband is gone so that you may know everything from me old man
to the holy tent to celebrate a feast and birthrites for his son in secret from her and to give a public banquet to his new son
tutor
lady we are betrayed for i am afflicted with you by your husband and by trickery
we are outraged and cast out of the house of erechtheus i do not say this in hatred to your husband but i love you more than him he married you when he came as a stranger to the city receiving both the royal home and your full inheritance
and now he is shown to have secretly bred children by some other woman how secretly i will tell you when he saw you had no child he could not endure to bear a fate like yours but he bedded a slave in secret union
and begot this child and gave him to some delphian to bring up abroad this man educated him dedicated to the god in this sacred house so that he might conceal it when xuthus knew that the youth was grown he persuaded you to come here for the sake of your childlessness
and the god has not deceived you your husband deceived you long ago rearing his son and wove such plots if convicted he might ascribe it to the god    he was about to invest him with the rule of your land
and he fashioned this new name at his leisure ion because he met him coming out indeed
chorus leader
alas how i always hate wicked men who put together plans of injustice and then adorn them with tricks i would rather have as a friend a good man who is ordinary
than an evil man who is more clever
tutor
and you will be persuaded to the last evil of all to take into your house as master someone motherless insignificant born from a slave woman the evil would have been a single one if he had persuaded you
by pleading your lack of children and settled in the house a son of a noble mother or if that displeased you he should have sought a wife from the aeolians now indeed you must act a womans part with a sword or by some trick or with poison
kill your husband and his son before death comes to you from them for if you give up your life is lost for when two enemies come together under one roof either one must fail or the other
i wish to help you in this work and kill the boy entering the house where he is preparing the feast and when i have paid back my living to my masters either to die or live and see the light there is one thing in slavery that brings shame
the name in all other respects a good slave is no worse than the freeborn
chorus leader
and i my dear mistress wish to share your fate either to die or live with honor
creusa
creusa
o my soul how shall i be silent
but how shall i reveal the hidden bed and depart from shame what hindrance is still in my wayagainst whom am i set in a contest of virtue is not my husband my betrayer
and i am deprived of a house deprived of children the hopes are gone which i wished to arrange well but could not when i was silent on this union silent on the lamented birth
but by the starry throne of zeus and by the goddess high above my rocks by the sacred headland of tritons watery lake i will no longer conceal this bed so that
i may cast off this load from my breast and be at ease tears fall from my eyes my soul is in pain victim of plots by men by gods whom i will show to be
ungrateful betrayers of the beds they forced
o you who cause a voice to sing from your sevenstringed lyre a voice that lets lovelysounding hymns peal forth in the rustic lifeless horn
son of leto i will blame you before this light you came to me your hair glittering with gold when i was plucking into the folds of my robe yellow flowers
to bloom with golden light grasping my white hand in yours you led me to the bed in the cave hearing me call on my mother god and consort
shamelessly paying homage to aphrodite i the unhappy one bore you a son whom in fear of my mother i placed in that bed of yours
where you joined with me the miserable the unfortunate one in unhappy union alas and now my son and yours oh cruel one is gone torn apart a feast for birds
but you are singing to the lyre chanting hymns
oh son of leto i invoke you who send forth your holy voice from your golden seat
your central throne i shall announce it in your ear o wicked lover you received no favor from my husband
but you settle a child in the house for him while my son and yours unknown is gone plundered by birds and has given up the babyclothes from his mother delos hates you and so do the laurel shoots
beside the palm with delicate leaves where leto gave birth to you a holy birth in the plants of zeus
chorus leader
alas what a mighty treasury of ills is opened anyone might weep at it
tutor
my daughter i cannot get my fill of looking on your face i am astonished for i had just now drained one wave of troubles from my heart when another one from the stern seizes me at your words which you have diverted from the present woes
and now you have set forth on a sad road of other sorrows what are you saying what charge do you bring against loxias what son do you say you have brought forth and where in the city did you place his body dear to the wild beasts please go through it again
creusa
i am ashamed old man yet i will speak
tutor
i know how to mourn generously with friends
creusa
hear then you know the cave to the north of the cecropian rocks which we call macrai
tutor
yes where there is a shrine to pan and altars near by
creusa
there i engaged in a dreadful contest
tutor
what contest how my tears come to meet your words
creusa
unwillingly i formed an unhappy union with phoebus
tutor
o daughter was this what i have heard
creusa
i dont know but i would tell you if you speak the truth
tutor
you were secretly mourning a hidden disease
creusa
this was the grief i am now making clear to you
tutor
and then how did you conceal apollos rape
creusa
i gave birth    hear me with patience old man
tutor
where who assisted you at the birth or were you in labor alone
creusa
alone in the cave where i had been joined with him
tutor
where is the child so that you may no longer be childless
creusa
he is dead old man exposed to wild beasts
tutor
dead and the cowardly apollo did not defend him
creusa
he did not the boy is growing up in the house of hades
tutor
who exposed him surely it wasnt you
creusa
i did it in darkness wrapping him in robes
tutor
and no one shared in your knowledge of the childs exposure
creusa
only the misfortune and the concealment
tutor
and how did you dare to leave your son in a cave
creusa
how with many mournful words
tutor
ah cruel was your daring but the god was more cruel than you
creusa
if you had seen the child stretch out his hands to me
tutor
seeking the breast or reaching for your arms
creusa
here where he suffered wrong from me being absent from my arms
tutor
and what thought induced you to expose your child
creusa
that the god would save his own offspring
tutor
alas how storms have buffeted the prosperity of your house
creusa
why do you cover your head and weep old man
tutor
i see you and your father unfortunate
creusa
this is the state of man nothing stands firm
tutor
let us no longer cling to sorrow my daughter
creusa
what should i do there is no way out of misfortune
tutor
first be avenged on the god that wronged you
creusa
and how being mortal shall i outrun those who are stronger
tutor
burn the holy oracle of loxias
creusa
i am afraid i have enough ills even now
tutor
dare what may be done then kill your husband
creusa
i revere our marriage to which he was faithful once
tutor
then kill the son who has appeared against you
creusa
how if only it could be how i would wish it
tutor
arm your servants with swords
creusa
i will go but where shall it be done
tutor
in the holy tent where he is now feasting his friends
creusa
the murder is evident and slaves are powerless
tutor
ah you are being cowardly come you form a plan now
creusa
indeed i have one treacherous and effective
tutor
i would be your servant in both these respects
creusa
listen then you know the battle of the giants
tutor
yes the battle the giants fought against the gods in phlegra
creusa
there the earth brought forth the gorgon a dreadful monster
tutor
as an ally for her children and trouble for the gods
creusa
yes and pallas the daughter of zeus killed it
tutor
what fierce shape did it have
creusa
a breastplate armed with coils of a viper
tutor
is this the story which i have heard before
creusa
that athena wore the hide on her breast
tutor
and they call it the aegis pallas armor
creusa
it has this name from when she darted to the gods battle
tutor
but what harm is this to your enemies daughter
creusa
do you know erichthonius but of course you do old man
tutor
the one whom the earth brought forth first of your race
creusa
to him while an infant pallas gave
tutor
what did she give your speech has such delays
creusa
two drops of blood from the gorgon
tutor
and what power do they have over mortals
creusa
one is deadly the other heals disease
tutor
in what did she hang them around the infants body
creusa
in gold chains and he gave them to my father
tutor
and when he died they came to you
creusa
yes i wear them on my wrist
tutor
how is this double gift of the goddess accomplished
creusa
this one which dripped from the hollow vein at the slaughter
tutor
what is its use what can it do
creusa
it wards off diseases and nourishes life
tutor
the second one you speak of what does it do
creusa
it kills as it is poison from the gorgon serpents
tutor
do you wear them mixed together or separately
creusa
separate for good does not mix with ill
tutor
o dearest child you have all that you need
creusa
with this the boy shall die and you will be the one to kill him
tutor
where and how it is for you to say it and for me to dare it
creusa
at athens when he comes to my home
tutor
that was not well said i say this for you have found fault with me
creusa
how do you suspect what has come to me also
tutor
you will appear to destroy the child even if you dont kill him
creusa
rightly a stepmother is said to hate her stepchildren
tutor
kill him here so that you can deny the murder
creusa
and so i get the pleasure sooner in time
tutor
and you will conceal from your husband what he is eager to conceal from you
creusa
do you know what you must do take from my hand
this golden bracelet from athena an ancient work and go where my husband is secretly preparing the sacrifice when they finish dinner and are about to pour libations to the gods with this in your robe put it in the youths cup
but keep the cup apart for him alone not everyone the one who is going to be the master of my house and when it has gone down his throat he will never see glorious athens but he will die and remain hereshe gives him the bracelet
tutor
you go now to your hosts
i will accomplish what i have been ordered to do come then my aged foot be young in action even if you cannot be in years go with your master against the enemy and help me kill him and remove him from the house
it is good for the fortunate to honor piety but whenever someone wants to do harm to enemies no law stands in the waythey both go out
chorus
daughter of demeter goddess of the crossways you who rule over assaults by night
and day guide this cup full of death against the one my queen sends it to from the
drops of the earthborn gorgon her throat cut to the one who is grasping at the house of erechtheus may no other rule the citys households
than one of the noble race of erechtheus
chorus
but if death and the eager attempts of my mistress go unfulfilled and occasion for daring where there is now hope is absent a god will thrust a sharp sword or
hang a noose around her neck by sorrow making an end to sorrow she will go to other forms of life for never while she is alive would she endure
strangers ruling her home in the bright rays she who is born from a noble house
chorus
i am ashamed before the god of many hymns
if he the sleepless night watcher shall see the torch procession on the twentieth day beside the springs with lovely dances when the starry sky of zeus also joins in the dance
and the moon dances and the fifty daughters of nereus in the sea and the swirls of everflowing rivers celebrating in their dance
the maiden with golden crown and her revered mother where this vagabond of phoebus hopes to rule entering upon the labor of others
chorus
you who turn to music and sing in discordant hymns our beds and the lawless unholy loves of kypris see how we surpass in piety
the unjust seed of men let the song recant and let discordant music go against the beds of men the descendant of zeus
shows his ingratitude when he does not breed children for the house in common with my mistress showing favor to another aphrodite
he has found a bastard child
an attendant of creusa enters
attendant
women of athens where may i find our mistress the daughter of erechtheus i have completed a search of the whole city for her and i cannot find her
chorus leader
what is it my fellowslave why your
swiftness of foot what tidings do you bring
attendant
we are being hunted the rulers of the land seek her so that she may die by stoning
chorus leader
alas what are you saying we have surely not failed to keep secret our plans of murder against the boy
attendant
you are right you will not be among the last to share the punishment
chorus leader
how were the hidden contrivances seen
attendant
the god who did not wish to be stained with bloodpollution exposed that which was wrong and weaker than the right
chorus leader
how as a suppliant i beg you tell me about this
for when we know we would die more pleasantly whether we die or live

when creusas husband left the gods oracular shrine he took his new son to the feast and the sacrifice he was preparing for the god
xuthus then went where the flame of bacchus leaps so that he might drench both rocks of dionysos with the slaughter as a thankoffering for the sight of his son and he said you my child stay here and raise a tent fitted on both sides by the toil of carpenters
if i should remain a long time in my sacrifice to the gods of birth set up the banquet for the friends who are there
he took the calves and left the youth reverently built the round tent on pillars without walls taking good care of the rays of the sun
setting it neither towards the middle beams of heat nor in turn towards the ending ones he measured a length of  feet for a square having its whole area ten thousand feet as the wise say
so that he might call all the people of delphi to the feast from the treasuries he took sacred tapestries and shadowed over the tent a wonder for men to see first overhead he spread out wings of cloth a dedication of the son of zeus which herakles
brought from the amazons as spoils for the god these pictures were woven in it heaven gathering the stars into the circle of the sky the sun was driving his horses to the last flare drawing on the light of evening
darkrobed night was shaking her twohorse chariot by means of the yoked pair and stars attended her a pleiad hastened through the middle sky with orion and his sword above arktos turned his golden tail on the pole
the full moon that divides the months in half shot forth her beams above with the hyades the clearest sign for sailors and lightbearing dawn pursuing the stars ion spread other tapestries over the sides of the tent foreign ones
wellequipped ships against the hellenes and halfhuman creatures and the pursuit of deer on horseback and hunting of savage lions at the entrance there was cecrops with his daughters winding in his serpent coils
a dedication from an athenian
ion set up golden mixing bowls in the middle of the banquet the herald with quick steps was inviting any native of delphi who wished to come to the feast when the tent was filled they crowned themselves with garlands and ate the rich food
to satiety when they had let go this pleasure an old man came by and stood in the midst and he raised a great laugh among the guests by his zealous actions for he brought water for washing hands from the pitchers and burned
the myrtle incense and ruled over the the golden cups assigning this duty to himself
when it was time for music and the public bowl the old man said we must take away the small wine vessels and bring in the big ones
so that they may come to their pleasures more quickly then there was the work of bringing gold and silver cups he took up a chosen one as if to do a favor for the new master and gave him the full cup he had put in the wine
a deadly poison which they say his mistress had given him to kill the new son and no one knew this when xuthus revealed son was holding a libation among the rest one of the slaves said a profane word
he as one brought up within the temple and with expert seers thought it an omen and required another goblet to be filled afresh the former libations to the god he cast upon the ground instructing everyone to pour them out silence came over us we were filling
the sacred bowls with water and wine of byblos while we were at work a fluttering troop of doves burst into the tent for they live in phoebus house without fear and where they had poured out the wine the birds let down their beaks to it yearning for the drink
and they drew it into their beautifullyfeathered throats
the gods drinkoffering was harmless to the other doves but the one who sat where the new son had poured out his libation  and tasted the drink at once shook her body with its lovely plumes and whirled around and cried out with
an untelligible sound the whole crowd of guests was amazed at the birds torment she struggled and died stretching out her scarlet legs the son given by the prophet held his arms bare from his robe over the table
and shouted who intended to kill me let us know old man for you were being zealous and i received the cup from your hand at once he seized his aged arm and examined him so that he might catch the old man in the act with the poison
he was seen to have it and when tortured he painfully reported creusas daring and the contrivance of the cup at once the youth declared by loxias oracle collected the guests and rushed outside and standing in the midst of the pythian leaders said
o holy earth the stranger daughter of erechtheus tried to kill me with poison then the delphian lords and not by one vote only  decided that my mistress should die by being cast from the rock as she would have killed one dedicated to the god and done murder
in the temple the whole city is searching for her as she hastens on her unhappy way she came to phoebus in desire for children and has lost her life and her sons at once
chorus
there is no means of averting death
there is none for me the unhappy one  this is now clear from the libation to dionysos the swift viper mingled in death with the drops of the vine
the offering to the gods below is clear misfortune for my life a death by stoning for my mistress  by what winged flight or under the dark caverns of the earth shall i go
fleeing a death by stoning stepping on to the swift chariot or on to the prow of a ship
chorus leader
it is not possible to hide
when a god is not willing to snatch us away what remains my unhappy mistress for you to feel in your life shall we who planned to do wrong to another ourselves be punished as is right
creusa
creusa rushes in
my servants i am pursued to the death the pythian council has decreed it i am given up
chorus leader
unhappy lady we know your misfortunes how your fate stands
creusa
where then shall i fly i scarcely escaped death when i left the house i have come here by stealthy flight from my enemies
chorus leader
where else but to the altar
creusa
what will that gain me
chorus leader
it is not right to kill a suppliant
creusa
but by the law i perish
chorus leader
if you are caught
creusa
and here are my bitter opponents pressing on with drawn swords
chorus leader
now take your seat at the altar if you die here your blood will cry out
for vengeance on your murderers but your fate must be enduredcreusa takes refuge at the altar as ion guards and delphians enter
ion
o cephisus her ancestor with a bulls face what a viper have you bred or serpent that glares a deadly flame she has dared all she is no less than
the gorgons blood with which she was about to kill me seize her so that the uplands of parnassus from which she will be hurled to make her stony leaps may comb out those smooth tresses of her hair i met with a good genius before i came
to  the city of athens and fell into a stepmothers hands for in the midst of allies i have taken the measure of your intent what an unfriendly bane you were to me if you had encompassed me in your own house you would have sent me utterly to the house of hades
but neither the altar nor apollos shrine will save you pity for you is greater for me and for my mother although she is absent yet the name is present look at that wicked creature how she wove
craft out of craft she has fled cowering to the altar of the god as if she thought she would not pay the penalty for her deeds
creusa
i forbid you to kill me on behalf of myself and the god at whose altar i stand
ion
what is there in common between phoebus and you
creusa
i give my body to the god a holy suppliant
ion
and then you tried to poison the gods servant
creusa
you were no longer apollos but your fathers
ion
i was born from my father but i am speaking of the essential relationship
creusa
well then you were apollos once i am now you no longer are
ion
you are not pious but my actions were
creusa
i tried to kill you because you were an enemy to my house
ion
i certainly did not come in arms against your country
creusa
yes you did  you would have burned the house of erechtheus
ion
with what torches by what flame
creusa
you were going to live in my house taking it from me by force
ion
my father is giving me the land which he possessed
creusa
how does the race of aeolus share with that of pallas
ion
he received it in pledge by arms not words
creusa
an ally would not be an inhabitant of the land
ion
then you tried to kill me in fear of what i might intend to do
creusa
so that i might not die if you should not only intend
ion
because you are childless you are envious that my father found me
creusa
then you will plunder a childless house
ion
but do i have no share of my fathers goods
creusa
as much as his shield and spear that is your entire property
ion
leave the altar and the seats dedicated to the god
creusa
give advice to your mother wherever she is
ion
will you not submit to punishment you who were going to kill me
creusa
yes if you are willing to slaughter me in this shrine
ion
what pleasure is it for you to die among the garlands of the god
creusa
i shall give pain to one who has given me pain
ion
ah it is strange that the god has given to men these laws not well or with wise thought  the wicked should not sit at the altar
but should be driven from there nor is it good for a worthless hand to touch the gods for the righteous those who have been wronged should sit in sanctuary the good and bad  should not go to the same place and have equal treatment from the gods
as ion and his followers are about to tear creusa from the altar the priestess of apollo enters from the temple
priestess
hold back my child for i have left the oracular tripod and crossed the threshold i the priestess of phoebus who keep the ancient law of the tripod chosen from all the women of delphi
ion
welcome you who are a dear mother to me though not my parent
priestess
then may i be called so the name is not bitter to me
ion
have you heard that this woman was trying to kill me with her plots
priestess
i have but you are going astray in your cruelty
ion
shouldnt i requite those who would kill me
priestess
wives are always hostile to former offspring
ion
but we suffer greatly from stepmothers
priestess
do not do these things leaving the shrine and going to your country
ion
what must i be advised to do
priestess
go pure to athens with good omens
ion
all those that kill their enemies are pure
priestess
do not do it hear what i have to say
ion
speak whatever you say will be full of good will
priestess
do you see this vessel in my arms
ion
i see an ancient cradle in garlands
priestess
in this i received you when you were a newborn infant
ion
what are you saying a new story is introduced
priestess
i kept it in silence now i reveal it
ion
how did you hide it when you received me long ago
priestess
the god wanted to have you as a servant in his house
ion
but now he doesnt want it how must i know this
priestess
he has declared your father and sends you from this land
ion
you kept these things because you were bidden to or how
priestess
loxias put it into my mind
ion
to do what speak finish what you have to say
priestess
to keep to this time what i found
ion
what gain does this have for me or what harm
priestess
the babyclothes in which you were wrapped are hidden here
ion
you are producing a means to find my mother
priestess
since the god wishes it before he did not
ion
o day of blessed discoveries
priestess
now take them and find your mother
ion
i will go over all asia and the boundaries of europe
priestess
you yourself will know these things for the sake of the god i nurtured you my son and i will give you these which he wished me unbidden to keep
and save why he wanted this i do not understand no mortal knew that i had these things or where they were hidden and now farewell i take leave of you just as a mother does begin where you ought to seek your mother
first if some delphian girl gave you birth and exposed you in this shrine then if she was someone of hellas you have everything from me and from phoebus who took part in your fateshe goes into the temple after giving ion the cradle
ion
ah me how the tears fall from my eyes
when i think on that time when my mother after a hidden union sold me secretly and did not allow me the breast but in the temple of the god without a name i had a slaves life all from the god is good but from fortune
harsh for in the time when i should have luxuriated in a mothers arms and had some pleasure in life i was deprived of a mothers tender care and she also is unhappy how she has suffered losing the delight of a child
but i will take this vessel and dedicate it to the god so that i may find nothing that i do not want for if my mother happens to be a slave to find her would be worse than to let it be in silence o phoebus in your temple i dedicate this
but what am i doing am i making war against the will of the god who saved for me these tokens of my mother i must dare and open these for i would not transgress what is fated
he opens the cradle
o sacred garlands what have you so long concealed
and bands that keep these things so dear to me see how from some gods device the cover of this circular vessel is not worn and mold is absent from the weave but much intervening time has passed for these treasures
creusa
what unexpected sight do i see
ion
you be silent you know that you have said enough to me before
creusa
i cannot be silent do not give me advice for i see the cradle in which i once exposed you my son when you were still an infant
in the caves of cecrops and the overhanging rocks of macrai i will leave this altar even if i must die
ion
seize her for she has been driven mad by the god and has left the wooden images of the altar bind her hands
creusa
do not hesitate to kill me i shall lay claim to this vase
and you and your concealed tokens
ion
isnt this terrible i am being seized by your talk
creusa
no but you have been found to be dear to your own
ion
i am dear to you and you were trying to kill  me secretly
creusa
you are my child if that is most dear to parents
ion
stop weaving your plots i will certainly catch you out
creusa
may i come to what i am aiming at my child
ion
is this vessel empty or does it cover something
creusa
yes your clothes in which i then exposed you
ion
and will you name them to me before you see them
creusa
if i do not say them i consent to die
ion
speak your daring has something strange in it
creusa
look cloth that i wove as a child
ion
what sort girls weave many things
creusa
not completed like a practicework from the loom
ion
what appearance does it have you will not catch me in this way
creusa
a gorgon in the middle threads of the robe
ion
o zeus what fate hunts me down
creusa
and like an aegis bordered with serpents
ion
look that is the robe as we are finding out the oracle
creusa
o longlost work of my loom when i was a girl
ion
is there anything else besides or are you lucky in this only
creusa
serpents an old gift of athena in gold she tells us to rear children in imitation of erichthonius of long ago
ion
tells you to do what with the gold how to  use it explain it to me
creusa
necklaces for the newborn baby to wear my child
ion
they are here i long to know the third thing
creusa
i put an olive crown around you from the tree that athena first brought out of the rock
if it is there it has not lost its green but flourishes born from an immortal olive tree
in the following scene most of ions lines are spoken most of creusas are sung
ion
o my dearest mother i see you with joy i am held to your joyful facethey embrace
creusa
o child o light dearer to your mother than the sun
the god will forgive me i hold you in my arms unexpectedly found when i thought you lived in the world below with the dead and persephone
ion
but my dear mother in your arms i seem to be both one who has died and one who is not dead
creusa
oh oh wide expanse of the bright sky what shall i say what shall i cry aloud from where did this unexpected pleasure come to me where have i found this joy
ion
there was nothing further from my thoughts than this mother to be found your son
creusa
i am still trembling with fear
ion
thinking that you do not have me although you are holding me
creusa
yes for i had cast these hopes far away o lady from whom did you take my child into your arms
what hand brought him to apollos shrine
ion
it was a gods action but may the rest of our fortune be happy as the past was unfortunate
creusa
my child you were brought forth in tears with laments you were separated from a mothers hands
but now i breathe beside your cheeks with most blessed delight
ion
you are speaking for me when you speak your thoughts
creusa
i am no longer childless the house is established the land has a king
erechtheus has come back and the house of the earthborn no longer gazes upon night but looks up into the rays of the sun
ion
mother let my father since he is present here also share the joy which i have given you
creusa
o child what are you saying how i am convicted
ion
what have you said
creusa
you were born from another
ion
ah me you gave birth to me as a virgins bastard
creusa
my wedding rites had no torches or dances child when i bore you
ion
alas i am lowborn mother who was my father
creusa
may the gorgons slayer know
ion
why have you said this
creusa
you who sit on the hill
where the olive grows beside my cliffs
ion
what you say is treacherous and not clear to me
creusa
by the nightingales rock apollo
ion
why do you speak of apollo
creusa
led me in secret to his bed
ion
speak on your words bring some joyful fortune to me
creusa
in the tenth month i bore you to phoebus with secret pangs
ion
what you are saying is very sweet if you are speaking the truth
creusa
i fitted around you these babyclothes the work of my flying shuttle done when i was a girl in secret from my mother i did not offer you milk nor a mothers nourishment from the breast nor did i wash you you were cast out on the deserted cave
a victim of the beaks of birds and a feast for hades
ion
mother you dared to do terrible things
creusa
bound down by fear my son i cast your life away
unwillingly i killed you
ion
and i was about to kill you
creusa
ah dreadful was my fortune then dreadful these things also i am whirled here
and there to misery and back again to joy but the wind is changing let it remain the past evils are enough now let there be a favoring breeze after troubles my son
chorus leader
from what has happened now let no mortal ever consider anything unexpected
ion
o fortune you that have already changed the lives of countless mortals involving them in ills and raising them to happiness again to what a point of life had i come
ready to kill my mother and suffer unworthily ah is it possible to learn all this day by day in the suns bright encircling rays i have made a dear find in you mother nor do i see anything to blame in my birth
for the rest i want to talk to you alone come here for i wish to say this in your ear and draw a dark veil over the matter look mother isnt it true that  you went astray into a secret affair an affliction that happens to girls
and now you are ascribe the blame to the god and attempt to escape the shame of my birth by saying that you bore me to phoebus when your lover was not a god
creusa
by athena nike who once raised her shield against the giants in her chariot beside zeus
your father is not a mortal but the one who who brought you up lord loxias
ion
how then did he give his child to another father and say that i was born the son of xuthus
creusa
not born but he gives you
born from himself for so a friend might give to a friend his son to be master of the house
ion
the god is true or prophecy is in vain this troubles my heart mother and with reason
creusa
hear now what has come to me my child
apollo establishes you in a noble house as a kindness to you but if you were said to be his you could not ever have a wealthy home or a fathers name how could it be since i myself concealed the union and tried to kill you secretly
but he gives you to another father to benefit you
ion
my search is not so careless i will go into phoebus house and ask him if i have a mortal father or loxias
athena appears from above
ah what god is revealing a countenance as bright as the sun
above the house that breathes incense let us try to escape mother before we see divinities if it is not the proper time for us to see them
athena
athena
do not try to escape for you are fleeing one who is not an enemy but gracious to you both in athens and here
i pallas have come from your land which is named after me urged on my course by apollo for he does not think it fitting to come into your sight lest blame for what happened before should arise  but he sends me to tell you this
that she bore you to apollo your father and he makes a gift of you not to the one who begot you but so that he may establish you in a most noble house when this matter was made known and revealed since he feared that you would die by the plots of your mother
and she at your hands he rescued you by his contrivances  lord apollo keeping silent over these things was going to make them known at athens that she is your mother and you are born from her and your father phoebus but to bring the matter to an end hear the oracles of the god
for which i yoked my chariot
creusa take your son and go to the land of cecrops set him on the royal throne for he was born from erechtheus and is fit to rule my land
and he will be famous throughout hellas he will have four sons from one stock and they will gave names to the land and the tribes of people who inhabit it geleon will be the first then second
hopletes and argades and the aegicores will have a tribal  name from my aegis their sons in turn at the appointed time will settle in the island cities of the cyclades and  the lands along the shore which will give strength to my land
they will colonize the plains of the two mainlands asia and europe on opposite sides they will become famous under the name of ionians in homage to this boys name you and xuthus will have children together
dorus from whom the dorian state will be celebrated throughout the land of pelops the second son achaeus will be king of the shore land near rhion and a people called after him will be marked out as having his name
apollo has done all things well first he had you give birth without pain so that your family would not know about it when you bore this child and put him in his clothes he ordered hermes to take up the baby in his arms and bring him here
he nurtured him and did not allow him to die now do not reveal that he is your son so that xuthus may have his belief in content and you too may go forth with your blessings lady and now farewell from this relief from ills
i announce a prosperous fortune for you
ion
o pallas daughter of allpowerful zeus not with distrust shall we receive your words i am convinced that phoebus is my father and she is my mother and that i did not doubt before
creusa
hear now my words also i praise phoebus whom i did not praise before
because he gives back to me the child that he once neglected these gates are lovely to my eyes and the oracles of the god which were hostile before but now i gladly cling to the handle of the door and address the gates
athena
i am glad that you have changed your mind and praise the god for always
the gifts of heaven are somehow slow but at the end they are not weak
creusa
my son let us go home
athena
go i will escort you
creusa
a worthy guide for us
athena
and friendly to the city
creusa
sit on the ancient throne
ion
a worthy possession for meion creusa and athena leave the stage
chorus
o son of leto and zeus apollo hail the one whose house is striken
by misfortune must have courage and honor the gods for at the end the good obtain what they have deserved but the bad by nature can never fare well
