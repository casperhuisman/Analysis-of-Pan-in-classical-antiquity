enter the chorus of trojan guards
chorus
go to hectors couch which of you squires that tend the prince or you armorclad men is awake he ought to receive fresh tidings
from the warriors who were set to guard the assembled army during the fourth watch of the night calls to hector in the tent  lift up your head prop your arm beneath it unseal that fierce eye from its repose quit your lowly couch of scattered leaves
hector it is time to hearken
hector
who is this is it a friend who calls who are you your password speak who are these who come near my couch in the night you must tell me
chorus
sentinels of the army
hector
why this tumultuous haste
chorus
be of good courage
hector
i am is there some midnight ambush
chorus
no
hector
why do you desert your post and rouse the army unless you have some tidings of the night
are you not aware how near the argive army we take our nights repose clad in all our armor
chorus
to arms hector seek your allies sleeping camp
stir them up to wield the spear awake them
despatch a friend to your own company bridle the horses
who will go to the son of panthus who to europas son captain of the lycian band
where are they who should inspect the victims
where are the leaders of the lightarmed troops and the phrygian archers
string your horntipped bows
hector
your tidings inspire now fear
now confidence nothing is plainly set forth can it be that you are smitten with wild fear by pan the son of cronion leaving your watch you rouse the army what does your noisy summons mean what tidings can i say you bring your words are many
but no plain statement have you made
chorus
the long night through hector the argive army has kindled fires and bright with torches shines the anchored fleet to agamemnons tent the whole army
move clamorously by night eager for fresh orders for never before has the seafaring company been so alarmed and so i was suspicious of what might happen
and came to tell you so that you may have no cause to blame me hereafter
hector
in good season you come although your tidings are full of terror for those men are bent on giving me the slip and stealing away from this land in their ships by night
their midnight signalling pleases me ah fortune to rob me in my hour of triumph a lion of his prey before this spear had made an end of the whole argive army in one line yes if the suns bright lamp had not withheld
his light i would not have stayed my victors spear before i had fired their ships and made my way from tent to tent drenching this hand in achaean blood i was eager to make a night attack and take advantage of the stroke of luck sent by heaven
but those wise seers of mine who have heavens will so pat persuaded me to wait for dawn and then leave not one achaean in the land but those others do not await the counsels of my soothsayers darkness turns runaways to heroes
but we must now without delay pass this word to the army to take up arms and cease from slumber so that many an achaean as he leaps aboard his ship shall be smitten through the back and sprinkle the ladders with blood and others shall be fast bound with cords
and learn to till our phrygian fields
chorus leader
you hasten hector before you know clearly what is happening for we do not know for certain whether the men are flying
hector
what other reason did the argive army have to kindle fires
chorus leader
i do not know i am very suspicious
hector
if you fear this be sure theres nothing you would not fear
chorus leader
never before did the enemy kindle such a blaze
hector
no nor ever before did they suffer such shameful defeat and rout
chorus leader
this you have achieved look now to what remains to do
hector
a simple tale to arm against the enemy
chorus leader
look here comes aeneas in great haste too with news to tell his friends
aeneas
hector why have the sentinels in terror made their way through the army at night to your couch to hold a midnight conclave and disturb the army
hector
encase yourself in your armor aeneas
aeneas
what is it have tidings come of some secret stratagem set on foot during the night by the foe
hector
the men are flying and going aboard their ships
aeneas
what sure proof can you give of this
hector
the whole night they are kindling blazing torches i think they will not wait for tomorrow but after lighting brands upon their ships decks will leave this land and fly to their homes
aeneas
and you why do you gird on your sword
hector
with my spear i will stop them even as they fly and leap aboard their ships and my hand shall be heavy upon them for it is shameful in us yes and cowardly as well as shameful when the god gives them into our hands to let our foes escape without battle after all the injuries they have done us
aeneas
would you were as sage as you are bold but to be sure among mortals the same man is not dowered by nature with universal knowledge each has his special gift appointed him yours is battle anothers is sage counsel you are excited to hear that the achaeans are
lighting blazing torches and you would lead on our troops across the ditches in the calm still night now after crossing the deep yawning trench supposing you should find the enemy are not flying from the land but are awaiting your onset
beware lest you suffer defeat and so never reach this city again for how will you pass the palisades in a rout and how shall your charioteers cross the bridges without dashing the axles of their cars to pieces and if victorious you have next the son of peleus to engage
he will never allow you to cast the firebrand on the fleet or harry the achaeans as you believe no for that man is fierce as fire a very tower of might let us rather then leave our men to sleep calmly under arms after the weariness of battle
while we send as i advise whoever will volunteer to spy upon the enemy and if they really are preparing to fly let us arise and fall upon the argive army but if this signalling is a trap to catch us we shall discover from the spy the enemys designs
and take counsel such is my advice lord
chorus
it pleases me well so change your mind and adopt this counsel i do not love hazardous commands in generals what is better than for a swiftfooted spy to approach the ships
and learn why our foes are lighting fires in front of their naval station
hector
since this finds favor with you all prevail to aeneas  go and calm the allies perhaps the army hearing of our midnight council is disturbed
mine shall it be to send one forth to spy upon the foe and if i discover any plot among them you shall fully hear of it and be present to learn the report but in case they are starting off in flight with eager ear await the trumpets call
for then i will not stay but will this very night engage the argive army there where their ships are hauled up
aeneas
send out the spy at once theres safety in your counsels now and you shall find me steadfast at your side whenever occasion calls
hector
what trojan of those present in council
volunteers to go and spy on the argive fleet who will be that patriot who says yes i myself cannot at every point serve my country and my friends in arms
dolon
i for my country will gladly run this risk
and go to spy on the argive fleet and when i have learned fully all that the achaeans plot i will return i undertake this toil on these conditions
hector
true to his name indeed his countrys friend is dolon your fathers house was famed before
but now you have made it doubly so
dolon
so must i toil but for my pains i should receive fitting wages for set a reward on any deed and it breeds a double favor
hector
yes that is fair i cannot dispute it
name your wage except for my sovereignty
dolon
i do not covet your toilsome sovereignty
hector
well then marry a daughter of priam and become my brotherinlaw
dolon
no i do not wish to marry among those beyond my station
hector
theres gold if this youll claim as your prize
dolon
i have it in my home i lack no sustenance
hector
what then is your desire of all that ilium stores within her
dolon
promise me my gift when you conquer the achaeans
hector
i will give it to you ask anything except the captains of the fleet
dolon
slay them i do not ask you to keep your hand off menelaus
hector
is it the son of oileus you would ask me for
dolon
hands that are well brought up are worthless at farming
hector
whom then of the achaeans will you have alive to hold to ransom
dolon
i told you before my house is stored with gold
hector
why then you shall come and with your own hands choose out some spoil
dolon
nail up the spoils for the gods on their temples
hector
then what greater prize than these will you ask me for
dolon
achilles horses the prize must be worth the toil when one stakes ones life on fortunes dice
hector
ah but your desires clash with mine about those horses
for they are immortal and born from immortals who bear the son of peleus on his headlong course poseidon lord of the ocean broke them and gave them to peleus so runs the legend yet for i urged you on i will not break my word i will give to you
achilles team a fair possession for your house
dolon
i thank you in receiving then i assert that i am taking a fairer gift than any other phrygian for my bravery yet you should not be envious you have other things to gladden your heart in your kingship over this land
chorus
great the enterprise and great the reward you design to receive happy yes happy will you be if you succeed fair the fame your toil shall win yet it is a great thing to become the brotherinlaw of princes on the gods decrees let justice keep her eye
what man can give you have it seems in full
dolon
i will set forth but going within my house i will clothe myself in fitting attire and then i will hasten to the argive fleet
chorus leader
why what dress in place of this will you assume
dolon
one that fits my task and furtive steps
chorus leader
one should ever learn wisdom from the wise tell me what will be your equipment
dolon
i will fasten a wolfskin about my back and over my head put the brutes gaping jaws
then fitting its forefeet to ny hands and its hindfeet to my legs i will go on allfours in imitation of a wolfs gait to puzzle the enemy when i approach their trenches and barriers round the ships rut whenever i come to a deserted spot
i will walk on two feet such is the ruse i have decided on
chorus leader
may hermes maias child escort you safely there and back prince of tricksters as he is you know what you have to do good luck is all you need now
dolon
i shall return in safety and bring to you the head of odysseus
when i have slain him or the son of tydeus and with this clear proof before you you shall assert that dolon went to the argive fleet for before the dawn i will come back home with bloodstained handexit dolon
chorus
lord of thymbra and of delos who haunt
your temple in lycia apollo o divine head come with all your archery appear this night and by your guidance save this man
and aid the dardanians o almighty god whose hands in days of old built the walls of troy
chorus
may he come to the ships may he reach the army of hellas and spy it out then turn again and reach the altars of his fathers
home in ilium may he mount the chariot drawn by phthias horses when our master has sacked achaeas camp
those horses that the seagod gave to peleus son of aeacus
chorus
for he alone had heart enough for home and country to go and spy on the naval station i admire
his spirit how few stout hearts there are when on the sea the sunlight dies and the city labors in the surge
phrygia yet has left a valiant few and bold hearts in the battles press it is only mysias sons who scorn us as allies
chorus
which of the achaeans will the earthtreading murderer slay
in their beds as he pretends to be a fourfooted beast on the ground may he lay menelaus low slay agamemnon and bring his head
to helens hands causing her to lament her evil kinsman who has come against my city against the land of troy with his army of a thousand ships
messenger
lord in days to come may it be mine
to bring my masters such news as i am bearing to you now
hector
often the rustic mind is afflicted with dullness so you have probably come to this illsuited place to tell your master in armor about the sheep do you not know my palace or my fathers throne
where you should carry your tale when you have prospered with your flocks
messenger
dull we herdsmen are i do not dispute it but none the less i bring joyful news to you
hector
cease your tale of how the sheepfold fares i have battles to fight and spears to wield
messenger
the very things of which i too came to tell you for a chieftain of a countless army is on his way to join you as your friend and ally of this land
hector
his country and the home that he has left
messenger
thrace men call his father strymon
hector
did you say that rhesus was setting foot in troy
messenger
you have it and lighten me of half my speech
hector
how is it that he comes to idas meadows wandering from the broad wagon track across the plain
messenger
i cannot say for certain though i might guess
it is no idle task for an army to make an invasion by night hearing that the plains are packed with foemens troops but he frightened us rustic shepherds who dwell along the slopes of ida the earliest settlement in the land as he came by night through the wood full of wild beasts
on surged the tide of thracian warriors with loud shouts at this in wild amazement we drove our flocks unto the heights for fear that some argives were coming to plunder and harry your steading till we caught the sound of voices
other than greek and ceased from our alarm  then i went and questioned in the thracian tongue those who were reconnoitring the road for their lord who it was that lead them and whose son he was called that came to the city to help the sons of priam
and when i had heard all i wished to learn i stood still and i see rhesus mounted like a god upon his thracian chariot of gold was the yoke that linked the necks of his horses brighter than the snow
and on his shoulders flashed his shield with figures welded in gold while a gorgon of bronze like that on the aegis of the goddess was bound upon the front of his horses ringing out its note of fear with many a bell the number of his army you could not reckon
to an exact sum for it was beyond ones comprehension many knights many ranks of targeteers many archers a great crowd of lightarmed troops arrayed in thracian garb to bear them company such the man who comes to troys assistance
whom the son of peleus will never escape either if he tries to escape or if he meets him spear to spear
chorus leader
whenever the gods stand by the citizens the tide of fortune glides with easy flow to a successful goal
hector
i shall find many friends now that fortune smiles
upon my warring and zeus is on my side but we have no need of those who did not share our toils long since when ares driving all before him was rending the sails of our ship of state with his tempestuous blast rhesus has shown the friendship he then bore to troy
for he comes to the feast although he was not with the hunters when they took the prey nor did he join his spear with theirs
chorus leader
you are right to scorn and blame such friends yet welcome those who wish to help the state
chorus leader
we who have long kept ilium safe are sufficient
chorus
are you so sure you have already caught the foe
hector
i am sure tomorrows light will make that plain
chorus leader
beware of what may happen often fortune veers about
hector
i loath the friend who brings his help too late but let him since he has arrived
come to our table not as an ally but as a guest for the gratitude of priams sons is forfeit in his case
chorus leader
o prince to turn away allies earns hatred
messenger
his mere appearance would cause a panic among the foe
hector
you counsel rightly you too take the proper view
let rhesus in his gilded armor join the allies of this land thanks to the messengers reportexit the messenger
chorus
may nemesis daughter of zeus check the word that may offend for lo i will utter all that it is dear
to my soul to say you have come o son of the river god you have come welcome in your advent to the halls of friendship since late in time your pierian mother and strymon river with fair bridges
are sending you to us
chorus
strymon who begot you his strong young son that day his swirling waters found a refuge in the tuneful muses virgin bosom
you are my zeus my god of light as you come driving your dappled horses  now o phrygia o my country now may you by gods grace address zeus the deliverer
chorus
shall old troy once more at last spend the whole day in drinking toasts and singing loves praise while the bewildering winecup sends a capacious challenge round
as over the sea for sparta the sons of atreus quit the ilian strand o friend with your arm and spear may you do me this service then safe return
chorus
hail all hail o mighty prince
fair the cub you have bred  thrace a ruler in his every look see his stalwart frame in golden corslet hark to the ringing bells that peal so proudly from his shieldhandle
a god o troy a god a very ares strymons colt and the tuneful muses has come to breathe courage into you
rhesus
brave son of father as brave hector prince of this land hail after many a long day i greet you
i rejoice at your success to see you camped hard on the enemy towers i am here to help you raze their walls and fire their fleet of ships
hector
son of that tuneful mother one of the muses and of thracian strymons river i love to speak
plain truth always nature did not give me a double tongue long long ago should you have come and shared the labors of this land and not allowed troy for any help of yours to fall overthrown by hostile argive spears you can not say it was any want of invitation
that kept you from coming with your help to visit us what herald or embassy from phrygia did not come to you urgently requiring your aid for our city what sumptuous presents did we not send to you but you brother barbarian though you were
pledged away to hellenes us your barbarian brothers for all the help you gave yet it was i with this arm that raised you from your paltry princedom to high lordship over thrace when i fell upon the thracian chieftains face to face around pangaeum in paeonias land
and broke their serried ranks and gave their people up to you enslaved but you have trampled on this great favor done you and come with laggard step to give your aid when friends are in distress while they whom no natural tie of kin constrains have long been here and some are dead and in their graves
beneath the heapedup cairn no mean proof of loyalty to the city and others in arms and mounted on their chariots with steadfast soul endure the icy blast and parching heat of the sun not pledging one another on couches as you do in long deep draughts
this is the charge i bring against you and utter to your face that you may know how frank is hectors tongue
rhesus
i too am just the same straight to the point i cut my way no shuffling nature is mine my heart was wrung with sorer anguish than yours
at my absence from this land i fumed and chafed but scythian people whose borders march with mine made war on me on the very eve of my departure for ilium i had reached the strand of the euxine sea there to transport my thracian army
then my spear poured out over scythias land great drops of bloody rain and thrace too shared in the mingled slaughter this then was what chanced to keep me from coming to the land of troy and joining your standard but as soon as i had conquered these and taken their children as hostages
and appointed the yearly tribute they should pay my house i have come sailing across the seas mouth and on foot traversing the other borders of your land not as you in your jeers at those carousals of my countrymen hint nor sleeping soft in gilded palaces
but amid the frozen hurricanes that vex the thracian sea and the paeonian shores learning as i lay awake what suffering is this soldiers cloak my only wrap true my coming has tarried but yet i am in time ten years already have you been at the fray
and accomplished nothing yet day in day out you fall throwing the dice of war with argives but the light of one day will be enough for me to sack those towers and fall upon their anchored fleet and slay the achaeans and on the next day i will go
home from ilium  at one stroke ending all your toil let none of you lay hand to spear to lift it for i for all my late arrival will with my lance make utter havoc of those vaunting achaeans
chorus
joy joy
sweet champion sent by zeus only may zeus throned on high keep jealousy resistless foe from you for your words that fleet of ships from argos never brought
neither formerly nor now among all its warriors a braver than you how i wonder will achilles how will aias stand the onset of your spear oh that i might see that day my prince
on which you may wreak vengeance on them gripping your lance in your deathdealing hand
rhesus
such exploits am i ready to achieve to atone for my long absence （with due submission to nemesis i say this） then when we have cleared this city of its foes
and you have chosen out firstfruits for the gods i wish to march with you against the argives country and at my coming lay hellas waste with war that they in turn may know the taste of ill
hector
if i could rid the city of this present curse
and restore it to its old security i should indeed feel deep gratitude towards the gods but as for sacking argos and the pasturelands of hellas with the spear it is no such easy task as you say
rhesus
do they not say that here came the greatest chiefs of hellas
hector
yes and i do not scorn them i have enough to do in driving them away
rhesus
well when we slay these is our task not fully done
hector
do not leave the present need to look to distant schemes
rhesus
you are it seems content to suffer and make no return
hector
yes for i rule a great empire even though i am here
but on the left wing or the right or in the centre of the allies you may plant your shield and marshal your troops
rhesus
alone i will face the foe hector but if you are ashamed after all your previous toil
to have no share in firing their ships prows place me face to face with achilles and his army
hector
against that man you cannot range your eager spear
rhesus
why it was surely said he sailed to ilium
hector
he sailed and he is here but he is angry
and takes no part with the other chieftains in the battle
rhesus
who next to him has won a name in their army
hector
aias and the son of tydeus are i take it in no way his inferiors there is odysseus a wheedling rascal but bold enough indeed
and of all men he has wrought most outrage on this country for he came by night to athenas shrine and stole her image and took it to the argive ships next he came inside our battlements clad as a vagrant in a beggars garb and loudly did he curse
the argives sent as a spy to ilium and then went out again when he had slain the sentinels and warders at the gate he is always to be found lurking in ambush about the altar of thymbrean apollo near the city in him we have a troubling pest to wrestle with
rhesus
no brave man thinks it right to kill his foe in secret but to meet him face to face if i can catch this fellow alive who as you say sits in stealthy ambush and plots his mischief i will impale him at the outlet of the gates
and set him up for winged vultures to make their meal upon this is the death he ought to die pirate and templerobber that he is
hector
to your quarters now for it is night for you i will myself point out a spot where your army
can watch this night apart from our array our password is phoebus if perhaps there should be need of it hear and remember it and tell it to the thracian army you must advance in front of our ranks and keep a watchful guard and receive dolon
who went to spy on the ships for he if he is safe is even now approaching the camp of troy
chorus
whose watch is it who relieves me nights earlier stars are on the wane and the seven
pleiads mount the sky in the middle of the heavens the eagle floats
rouse yourselves why delay up from your beds to the watch do you not see the moonlight
dawn is near dawn is coming and lo a star that heralds it
who was told off to the first watch
the son of mygdon whom they call coroebus
who after him
the paeonian contingent roused the cilicians and the mysians us
is it not then high time we went and roused the lycians for the fifth watch
as the lot decided
chorus
hark hark a sound sitting on her bloodstained nest by simois she sings with voice of many trills
her piteous plaint the nightingale that slew her child
already on ida they are pasturing the flocks and over the night i catch the shrill pipes note
sleep charms my eyes
for sleep is sweetest at dawn to tired eyelids
why does not our scout draw near whom hector sent to spy on the fleet
he is so long away i have my fears
is it possible he has plunged into a hidden ambush and been slain
perhaps i am afraid
my counsel is we go and rouse the lycians for the fifth watch as the lot ordained exit chorus
enter diomedes and odysseus cautiously with drawn swords
odysseus
did you not hear diomedes the clash of arms or is it an idle noise that rings in my ears
diomedes
no it is the rattle of steel harness on the chariot rails i too was afraid till i perceived it was the clang of horses chains
odysseus
beware lest you stumble upon the guard in the darkness
diomedes
i will take good care how i advance even in the gloom
odysseus
if however you should rouse them do you know their password
diomedes
yes it is phoebus i heard dolon use it
odysseus
ah i see the enemy have left this bivouac
diomedes
yet dolon surely said that here was hectors couch against whom this sword of mine is drawn
odysseus
what can it mean has his company withdrawn elsewhere
diomedes
perhaps to form some stratagem against us
odysseus
yes for hector is bold now by reason of his victory bold
diomedes
what then are we to do odysseus we have not found the man asleep our hopes are dashed
odysseus
let us go to the fleet with what speed we may some god whichever it be that gives him his good luck is preserving him against fate we must not strive
diomedes
then should we two not go against aeneas or paris most hateful of phrygians and with our swords cut off their heads
odysseus
well how in the darkness can you find them among a hostile army and slay them without risk
diomedes
yet it would be shameful to go to the argive ships
if we have done the enemy no harm
odysseus
what no harm have we not slain dolon who spied upon the anchored fleet and have we not his spoils safe here or do you expect to sack the entire camp
diomedes
i agree let us return and good luck go with us
athena
where are you going away from the trojan ranks with sorrow gnawing at your hearts because the god does not grant you two to slay hector or paris have you not heard that rhesus has come to aid troy in no mean fashion
if he survives this night until the dawn neither achilles nor aiass spear can stop him from utterly destroying the argive fleet razing its palisades and carrying this the onslaught of his lance far and wide within the gates
slay him and all is yours let hectors sleep alone no throatcutting slaughter for he shall find death at another hand
odysseus
queen athena it is the wellknown accent of your voice i hear for you are always
at my side to help me in my toil tell us where that man lies asleep in what part of the barbarian army is he stationed
athena
here lies he close at hand not marshalled with the other troops but outside the ranks hector has given him quarters
till night gives place to day and near him his white horses are tethered to his thracian chariot easy to see in the darkness they shine like the plumage of a river swan slay their master and bear them off
home glorious spoils for nowhere else in all the world is such a team to be found
odysseus
diomedes either you slay the thracian folk or leave that to me while your care must be the horses
diomedes
i will do the killing and you master the horses
for you are well versed in clever tricks and have a ready wit and it is right to station a man where he may best serve
athena
look there i see paris coming towards us perhaps he has heard from the guard a vague rumor that foes are near
diomedes
are others with him or does he come alone
athena
alone to hectors couch he seems to wend his way to announce to him that spies are in the camp
diomedes
ought he not head the list of slain
athena
you can not overreach destiny
it is not decreed that he should fall by your hand but hasten on your mission of foreordained slaughter while i feigning to be cypris his ally and to aid him in his efforts will answer the foe with unsound words
i tell you this but the fated victim does not know nor has he heard for all he is so nearexeunt odysseus and diomedes
paris
to you i call general and brother hector are you asleep should you not awake some enemy draws near our army
or thieves perhaps or spies
athena
courage see cypris watches over you in gracious mood your warfare is my concern for i do not forget the honor you once did me and i thank you for your good service and now when the army of troy is triumphant
i have come bringing to you a powerful friend the thracian child of the muse the heavenly singer his fathers name is strymon
paris
always to this city and to me you are a kind friend and i am sure that decision i then made
conferred you upon this city the highest treasure life affords i came when i heard a vague report  for a rumor prevailed amlng the guards that achaean spies are here one man that did not see them says so while another that saw them come cannot describe them
and so i am on my way to hectors tent
athena
fear nothing all is quiet in the army and hector has gone to assign a sleepingplace to the thracian army
paris
you persuade me and i believe your words and will go to guard my post free of fear
athena
go for it is my pleasure ever to watch your interests that so i may see my allies prosperous yes and you too shall recognize my zeal exit paris
in a loud voice to odysseus and diomedes son of laertes i bid you sheath your whetted swords you warriors all too keen
for the thracian chief lies dead and his horses are captured but the enemy know it and are coming against you fly with all speed to the ships station why delay saving your lives when the enemys storm is just bursting on you
enter the chorus odysseus and diomedes
chorus
oh oh
at them at them strike them strike them
who goes there look i mean that man
there are the thieves who in the gloom disturbed this army
come here here everyone
i have them i have clutched them fast
what is your company where did you come from who are you
odysseus
it is not for you to know for you will die today for your villainy
chorus
will you not declare the password before my sword finds its way to your heart
odysseus
halt be of good heart
chorus
come near strike everyone
odysseus
what have you slain rhesus
chorus
no but you who came to slay us
odysseus
stay every man of you
chorus
no no lay on
odysseus
ah do not slay a friend
chorus
what is the password then
odysseus
phoebus
chorus
right every man hold back his spear
do you know where the men have gone
odysseus
somewhere here i caught a sight of them
chorus
close on their track each man of you
or should we shout for aid
no it would be strange conduct to disturb our friends with wild alarms by nightexeunt odysseus and diomedes
chorus
who was that man who slipped away who was he that will loudly boast his daring in escaping me
how shall i catch him now to whom shall i liken him the man who came by night with fearless step passing through our ranks and the guard we set is he a thessalian or
a dweller in some seacoast town of locris or does he make his living among the islands scattered in the sea who was he where from what is his fatherland what god does he avow as lord of all the rest
whose work is this is it the deed of odysseus
if one may conjecture from his former acts of course it is
do you think so really
why of course
he is a bold foe for us
what strength whom are you praising
odysseus
do not praise the crafty weapons that a robber uses
chorus
once before he came into this city with swimming bleary eyes clad in rags and tatters his sword  hidden in his cloak
and like some vagrant menial he slunk about begging his living his head rough and dirty and he spoke bitterly of the royal house of the atreidae as though he were really opposed to those chiefs
would oh would he had perished as was his due before he set foot on phrygias soil
whether it was really odysseus or not i am afraid for hector will blame us sentinels
what can he allege
he will suspect
what have we done why are you afraid
they got past us
well who
the ones who came this night to the phrygian army
charioteer
oh oh cruel stroke of fate woe woe
chorus leader
hush be silent all crouch low for perhaps there comes someone into the snare
charioteer
oh oh dire mishap to the thracians
chorus leader
it is one of the allies who is groaning
charioteer
oh oh woe to me and to you o king of thrace how cursed the sight of troy to you
what an end to your life
chorus leader
who are you one of the allies nights gloom has dulled these eyes and i cannot clearly recognize you

where can i find some trojan chief where does hector
take his rest under arms to which of the captains of the army am i to tell my tale what sufferings ours what dark deeds someone has wrought on us and gone his way when he had wound up a ball of sorrow manifest to every thracian
chorus leader
from what i gather of this mans words some calamity it seems is befalling the thracian army
charioteer
lost is all our army our prince is dead slain by a treacherous blow oh oh
the cruel anguish of this bloody wound that racks my frame within would i were dead was it to die this inglorious death that rhesus and i came bringing aid to troy
chorus leader
he does not declare the disaster in riddles
no he clearly asserts our allies destruction
charioteer
charioteer
a sorry deed it was and more than that a deed most shameful yes it is an evil doubly bad to die with glory if die one must is bitterness enough i think to him who dies how not
though to the living it may add dignity and honor for their house but we have died foolishly and without glory no sooner had great hector given us our quarters and told us the password than we lay down to sleep upon the ground overcome by weariness no guard our army set
to watch by night nor were our arms set in array nor were the whips hung ready on the horses yokes for our prince was told that you were masters now and had encamped hard on their ships so carelessly we threw ourselves down to sleep
now i with thoughtful mind awoke from my slumber and with ungrudging hand measured out the horses feed expecting to harness them at dawn for the fray through the thick gloom two men i see roaming around our army but when i roused myself
they crouched low and were gone once more and i called out to them to keep away from the army for i thought they might be thieves from our allies nothing from them so i too said no more but came back to my couch and slept again
and as i slept a strange fancy came over me those horses that i had reared and used to drive stationed at rhesus side i saw i thought as in a dream with wolves mounted on their backs and these with their tails lashed the horses flanks
and urged them on while they snorted and breathed fury from their nostrils striving in terror to unseat their riders up i sprang to defend the horses from the brutes for the horror of the night scared me then as i raised my head i heard the groans of dying men
and a warm stream of newshed blood bespattered me beside my murdered master as he died to my feet i start but all unarmed and as i peer about and grope to find my sword a stalwart hand from somewhere near struck me with a sword
beneath the ribs i felt the swordthrust the deep gaping wound it gave me down on my face i fell while they fled clean away with horses and chariot oh oh tortured with pain too weak to stand a piteous object
i know what happened for i saw it but how the victims met their death i cannot say nor at whose hand but i can well surmise we have our friends to thank for this grief
chorus leader
charioteer of thraces hapless king
do not suspect us enemies did this but hector himself is here having learned your mischance he sympathizes as he should with your hard fate
hector
you who have caused this great calamity how did the enemys spies come
without your knowledge to your shame and spread destruction through the army and you did not drive them away either as they entered or left the camp who but you shall pay the penalty for this you i say were here to guard the army but they are gone without a wound with many a scoff
at phrygian cowardice and at me their leader now mark you this by father zeus i swear either the scourge or the headsmans axe awaits you for such conduct or else consider  hector to be nothing a mere coward
chorus
woe woe it was in quest of you yes you great lord of my city that i went when i brought news to you that the argive army was kindling fires about the ships
for by the springs of simois i vow my eye kept sleepless watch by night nor did i slumber or sleep do not be angry with me my lord i am guiltless of all
yet if hereafter you find that i in word or deed have done amiss bury me alive beneath the earth i ask no mercy
charioteer
why threaten these why try to undermine my barbarian mind with your subtle words you yourself a barbarian
you did this deed neither they who have died nor we who are wounded will believe it was any other a long and clever speech youll need to prove to me you did not slay your friends because you coveted the horses and to gain them murdered
your own allies after strongly imposing on them come they came they are dead paris found more decent means to shame the rights of hospitality than you who killed your allies no do not tell me some argive came and slaughtered us who could have passed the trojan lines
and come against us without detection you and your phrygian troops were camped in front of us who was wounded who was slain among your friends when that foe you speak of came it was we far off were wounded while some have met a sterner
fate and said farewell to the sunlight briefly then i blame no achaean for what enemy could have come and found the lowly bed of rhesus in the dark unless some god were guiding the murderers steps they did not know so much
as know of his arrival no this is your plot
hector
for a long time now i have had to do with allies yes ever since achaeas army settled in this land and never a harsh word have i known them say of me but with you i am to make a beginning never may such longing
for horses seize me that i should slay my friends this is the work of odysseus  for who of all the argives but he would have devised or carried out such a deed i fear him and  my mind is a little troubled lest he should have met and slain dolon as well
for he has been gone a long time and does not appear
charioteer
i do not know this odysseus of whom you speak it was no enemys hand that struck us
hector
if it pleases you to think that do so
charioteer
o land of my fathers would i might die in you
hector
die no enough are those already dead
charioteer
where am i to turn i ask you bereft of my master
hector
my house shall shelter you and cure you of your hurt
charioteer
how shall murderers hands care for me
hector
this fellow will never have done repeating the same story
charioteer
curses on the doer of this deed on you my tongue fixes no charge as you complain but justice is over all
hector
take him away carry him to my palace and tend him carefully that he may have no fault to find and you must go to those upon the walls
to priam and his aged councillors and tell them to give orders for the burial of the dead at the restingplace along the public roadthe charioteer is carried off
chorus
why does fate change and bring troy once again to mourning after her great good fortune planting what seeds
oh oh what deity above our heads o king bears in her hands as on a bier the newly slain corpse i shudder at this sight of woe
muse
behold metrojans for i the muse one of the nine sisters that have honor among the wise i am here having seen the piteous death his foes have dealt my darling son yet the crafty odysseus that slew him one day hereafter shall pay a fitting penalty
muse
o my son your mothers grief i mourn for you in my native strains of woe what a journey you made to troy a very path of illfortune and sorrow
starting in spite of all my warnings and your fathers earnest prayers in defiance of us woe to me for you my dear dear son ah woe
chorus leader
as far as one can who has no common tie of kin
i bewail and mourn your son
muse
curses on the son of oeneus curses on laertes child who has bereft me of my fair son and left me childless and on that woman too
that left her home in hellas and sailed here with her phrygian lover bringing death to you my dearest for the sake of troy and emptying countless cities of their brave heroes
muse
many indeed are the wounds thamyris son of philammon that you have inflicted on my heart in your life and in your death yes for it was your pride your own undoing and your rivalry with the muses that made me mother of this poor son of mine for as i crossed the rivers streams
i came too near to strymons fruitful couch that day we muses came to the brow of mount pangaeus with its soil of gold furnished forth with all our music for one great trial of minstrel skill with that clever thracian bard and we blinded him
thamyris the man who often reviled our craft
and then when i gave birth to you because i felt shame of my sisters and my virginity i sent you to the swirling stream of your father the river and strymon did not entrust your nurture to mortal hands but to the fountain nymphs
there you were reared most fairly by the maiden nymphs and you ruled over thrace a leader among men my child so long as you ranged your native land in quest of bloody deeds of prowess i did not fear for your death but i forbade you to set out for troy
in my knowledge of your doom but hectors sages and those countless embassies persuaded you to go and help your friends
this was your doing athena you alone are to blame for his death  neither odysseus nor the son of tydeus
had anything to do with it do not think it has escaped my eye and yet we sister muses do special honor to your city your land we chiefly haunt and those dark mysteries with their torch processions were revealed by orpheus cousin of this dead man
whom you have slain musaeus too your holy citizen of all men most advanced in lore was trained by phoebus and us the nine sisters and here is your reward for this in my arms i hold my child and mourn for him ill bring to you no other learned man
chorus leader
vainly it seems the thracian charioteer reviled us with plotting this mans murder hector
hector
i knew it it needed no seer to say that he had perished by the arts of odysseus now i when i saw the hellene army camped
in my land of course would not hesitate to send heralds to my friends bidding them come and help my country and so i sent and he as in duty bound came to share my toils i do not at all rejoice to see him dead and now i am ready to raise a tomb for him
and burn at his pyre great store of fine raiment for he came as a friend and in sorrow he is going away
muse
he shall not go into earths dark soil so earnest a prayer will i address to the bride of the nether world the daughter of the goddess demeter giver of increase
to release his soul and debtor as she is to me show that she honors the friends of orpheus and to me for the rest of time he will be as one who is dead and does not see the light for never again will he meet me or see his mother
but he will lie hidden in a cavern of the land with veins of silver restored to life a deified man just as the prophet of bacchus dwelt in a grotto beneath pangaeus a god whom his votaries honored
lightly now shall i feel the grief of the seagoddess
for her son too must die first then for you we sisters must chant our dirge and then for achilles when thetis mourns some day pallas your slayer shall not save him so true the shaft loxias keeps in his quiver for him
oh the sorrows that a mother feels the troubles of mortals whoever fairly reckons you up will live and die childless and will have no children to bury
chorus leader
his mother now must see to this mans burial but for you hector if you will carry out any scheme
now is the time for day is dawning
hector
go bid our allies arm at once and yoke the horses torch in hand you must await the blast of the etrurian trumpet for i hope to pass beyond their army
and walls and fire the ships of the achaeans bringing to the trojans this approaching beam of the sun as the day of freedom
chorus
obedience to our prince let us go to array ourselves in armor and tell these orders
to our allies perhaps the god who is on our side may grant us victory
