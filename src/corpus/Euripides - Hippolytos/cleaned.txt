aphrodite enters above the skene
aphrodite
aphrodite
mighty and of high renown among mortals and in heaven alike i am called the goddess aphrodite of all those who dwell between the euxine sea and the pillars of atlas and look on the light of the sun
i honor those who reverence my power but i lay low all those who think proud thoughts against me for in the gods as well one finds this trait they enjoy receiving honor from mortals
the truth of these words i shall shortly demonstrate
hippolytus theseus son by the amazon woman and ward of holy pittheus alone among the citizens of this land of trozen says that i am the basest of divinities he shuns the bed of love and will have nothing to do with marriage
instead he honors apollos sister artemis zeuss daughter thinking her the greatest of divinities in the green wood ever consort to the maiden goddess he clears the land of wild beasts with his swift dogs and has gained a companionship greater than mortal
to this pair i feel no grudging illwill why should i yet for his sins against me i shall punish hippolytus this day i have already come a long way with my plans and i need little further effort one day when he came from pittheus house
to the land of pandion to see and celebrate the holy mysteries of demeter his fathers highborn wife phaedra saw him and her heart was seized with a dreadful longing by my design and before she came to this land of trozen
she built hard by the rock of pallas athena a temple to aphrodite overlooking this land since she loved a foreign love after ages shall call this foundation aphroditenexthippolytus
but since theseus has left the land of cecrops
fleeing the bloodguilt he incurred for the murder of the pallantidae and sailed with his wife to this land consenting to a yearlong exile from his home from this point on the poor woman groaning and struck senseless by the goad of love means to die
in silence and none of her household knows of her malady but that is not the way this passion is fated to end i shall reveal the matter to theseus and it will come to light and the young man who wars against me shall be killed by his father with the curses the sealord
poseidon granted as a gift to theseus three times may theseus pray to the god and have his prayer fulfilled but phaedra noble though she is shall nonetheless die i do not set such store by her misfortune as to let my enemies off from
such penalty as will satisfy my heart
but now i see hippolytus coming finished with the toil of the hunt and so i shall leave this place a great throng of his servants treads close at his heels
and shouts hymning the praises of the goddess artemis clearly he does not know that the gates of the underworld stand open for him and that this days light is the last he shall ever look uponexit aphrodite enter hippolytus by eisodos a carrying a garland with a chorus of servants
hippolytus
sung
come follow me and sing of zeuss heavenly daughter
artemis who cares for us
hippolytus and chorus of servants
sung
lady lady most revered daughter of zeus my greeting daughter
of leto and of zeus of maidens the fairest by far who dwellest in the broad heaven in the court of your good father the gilded house of zeus
my greeting to you fair one fairest of all who dwell in olympus
hippolytus
for you lady i bring this plaited garland i have made gathered from an inviolate meadow
a place where the shepherd does not dare to pasture his flocks where the iron scythe has never come no it is inviolate and the bee makes its way through it in the springtime shamefast awe tends this garden with streams of riverwater for those to pluck who have acquired nothing by teaching but rather in whose very nature
chastity in all things has ever won its place the base may not pluck but dear lady take this coronal for your golden hair from a worshipful hand for i alone of mortals have this privilege
i spend my days with you and speak with you i hear your voice but never see your face may i end my life just as i have begun it
servant
lord for it is as gods that one should address ones masters would you take a piece of good advice from me
hippolytus
most certainly else i should not seem wise
servant
the rule observed by mortals do you know it
hippolytus
no what is the law you question me about
servant
to hate whats haughty and not friend to all
hippolytus
and rightly who thats haughty gives no pain
servant
and is there charm in affability
hippolytus
yes much and profit too with little toil
servant
do you think the same is true among the gods
hippolytus
yes if we humans follow heavenly usage
servant
how then no word for a high and mighty goddess
hippolytus
which careful lest your tongue commit some slip
servant
pointing to the statue of aphrodite
the goddess here who stands beside your gate
hippolytus
i greet her from afar for i am pure
servant
yet shes revered and famous among mortals
hippolytus
i do not like a god worshipped at night
servant
my son to honor the gods is only just
hippolytus
men have their likes in gods and men alike
servant
i wish you fortune and the good sense you need
hippolytus
go servants enter the house and prepare the meal after the hunt a full table
is a pleasure and you must rub down my horses so that when i am sated with meat i can yoke them to my chariot and give them their proper exercise
exit the chorus of servants into the palace
as for your aphrodite i bid her a very good dayexit hippolytus into the palace
servant
i however since we should not imitate the young
when their thoughts are like these shall pray in words befitting a slave to your statue my lady aphrodite you should be forgiving if youth makes someones heart stiff with pride and he utters folly pretend not to hear him
for gods should be wiser than mortalsexit servant into the palace enter by eisodos b women of trozen as chorus
chorus
there is a cliff dripping water whose source men say is the river oceanus it pours forth from its overhanging edge a flowing stream in which pitchers are dipped
it was there that i found a friend soaking her clothes in the riverwater and laying them out on the warm rocks broad back in the sun from there it was that i
first had news of my queen
chorus
she lies afflicted they say in a bed of sickness and keeps indoors with finespun cloths covering her blond head
and i hear that for three days now her mouth taking no food she has kept her body pure of demeters grain wishing because of some secret grief
to ground her lifes craft in the unhappy journeysend of death
chorus
has some god possessed you dear girl do your wits wander under the spell of pan or hecate the august corybantes or cybele the mountain mother
are you being worn down for some fault against dictynna her of the wild beasts and are you tainted with failure to offer the holy batter for she also haunts the lake and passes over the dry land
that stands in the eddies of the surf
chorus
or is it your husband the nobly born king of the erechtheid athenians does some other woman rule his passion someone in the palace making love to him apart from your bed
or has some sailor from crete put in at that harbor most hospitable to sailors bearing news to the queen and is her soul for this reason bound bedfast
in grief over her misfortunes
chorus
womens nature is an uneasy harmony and with it is wont to dwell the slack unhappy helplessness of birthpangs and their folly
through my womb also has this breath darted but i called on the heavenly easer of travail artemis mistress of arrows and she is always the gods be praised my muchenvied visitor
chorus leader
enter the nurse from the palace then phaedra supported by servants other servants bring a couch onto the stage on which the queen lies down
but here is her aged nurse before the door and she is bringing the queen out of the palace the cloud of unhappiness on her brow is growing my heart longs to know what it is why her body is so ravaged
its color so changed
nurse
oh the troubles mortals have the wretched diseases what shall i do to you what shall i not do here is daylight and here the bright sky and your sickbed stands now
outside the house for to come out here was all you talked of but soon you will hurry back into your chamber for you slip all too soon from contentment and you find joy in nothing taking no pleasure in what is at hand
but loving rather what is far off yet better it is to be sick than to tend the sick the first is a single thing while the second joins grief of heart to toil of hand but the life of mortals is wholly trouble
and there is no rest from toil anything we might love more than life is hid in a surrounding cloud of darkness and we are clearly unhappy lovers of whatever light there is that shines on earth
because we are ignorant of another life since the life below is not revealed to us we are borne along foolishly by mere tales
phaedra
raise up my body hold my head erect my limbs are unstrung
take my fair arms servants it is grievous to have this headdress on my head take it off spread my tresses on my shoulders
nurse
courage my child do not shift your body so roughly
you will bear up under your ailment more easily with calmness and nobility of mind mortals must endure trouble
phaedra
sung
oh oh how i long to draw a drink of pure water from a dewy spring
and to take my rest lying under the poplar trees and in the uncut meadow
nurse
my child what are these words of yours wont you stop saying such things before the crowd hurling wild words that are mounted on madness
phaedra
sung
take me to the mountain i mean to go to the wood to the pinewood where hounds that kill wild beasts tread running close after the dappled deer by the gods how i want to shout to the hounds
and to let fly past my golden hair a javelin of thessaly to hold in my hand the sharppointed weapon
nurse
why my child these fevered thoughts why concern yourself with hunting
why do you long for water from a flowing spring for hard by the city wall is a dewy slope from which you might have a drink
phaedra
sung
mistress of the salt lake artemis mistress of the coursingground for horses
oh that i might find myself on your ground taming enetic horses
nurse
what whirling words are these you utter yet again in your madness one time you are off going to the mountains to the hunt you long for another time on the sands
untouched by the waves you yearn for horses all this calls for a skilful diviner to say which of the gods is wrenching your head aside my child and striking your wits awry
phaedra
dear luckless me what have i done
where have i wandered from the path of good sense i was mad i fell by the stroke of some divinity oh how unhappy i am nurse cover my head up again for i am ashamed of my words
go on cover it the tears stream down from my eyes and my gaze is turned to shame for to be right in my mind is grievous pain while this madness is an ill thing best is to perish in unconsciousnessthe nurse veils phaedras head
nurse
i cover your head but when will my body be covered in death my long life has taught me many lessons mortals should not mix the cup of their affection to one another too strong
and it should not sink to their very marrow but the affection that binds their hearts should be easy to loosen easy either to thrust from them or to bind tightly it is a grievous burden that one soul should be in travail over two the way i
grieve for her men say that a way of life too unswerving leads more to a fall than to satisfaction and is more hurtful to health that is why i have much less praise for excess
than for moderation the wise will bear me out
chorus leader
old woman faithful nurse to the queen we see phaedras unhappy plight yet it is unclear to us what is wrong with her
we want to ask you and hear your answer
nurse
i have given up questioning her she will not say
chorus leader
not even how the trouble first began
nurse
tis all one on all these things she holds her tongue
chorus leader
how weak she is how wracked her body seems
nurse
no wonder shes been three days without food
chorus leader
is she deranged or does she mean to die
nurse
to die her fast no doubt will end her there
chorus leader
its very strange if this contents her husband
nurse
no for she hides it and denies shes ill
chorus leader
can he not guess by looking on her face
nurse
no for as it happens hes abroad
chorus leader
arent you then applying force trying to find out her malady what is causing her wits to wander
nurse
i have tried everything and made no progress
yet i shall not relax even now from my efforts so that you standing by may also bear witness on my behalf what kind of servant i have been to my masters in distress
come dear child let us both forget the words that are past you be more gracious
loosening your morose brow and the path your thoughts take while i where in the past i was not able to follow you sympathetically shall let that be and take another and better tack if your malady is one of those that are unmentionable here are women to help set it to rights
if your misfortune may be spoken of to men speak so that the thing may be revealed to doctors phaedra is silent  well why are you silent you ought not to be mute child but should either refute me if i have said something amiss or comply with the good advice i have given she is silent again
say something look at me oh unlucky me women it is in vain that i endure this toil and i am just as far off as before formerly words failed to soften her and now too she is not won over
but know well and in the face of this be more stubborn
than the sea if you like know that if you die you have betrayed your sons who shall have no share in their fathers house none i tell you in the name of that horseriding queen of the amazons who bore a master to rule over your sons a bastard with thoughts of legitimacy you know him well
hippolytus
phaedra
oh pain
nurse
does this then touch you close
phaedra
you have killed me nurse and i beg you by the gods to say nothing of this man again
nurse
you see you are in your right mind but though you are sane you are not willing to benefit your sons and to save your own life
phaedra
i love my children it is another fate that buffets me
nurse
your hands may i presume are clean of blood
phaedra
my hands are clean it is my heart thats stained
nurse
not spells i hope launched by some enemy
phaedra
a friend destroys me neither of us wills it
nurse
has theseus done some wrong against you then
phaedra
never may i be found out wronging him
nurse
what is this dread that makes you wish to die
phaedra
oh let me err it is not you i wrong
nurse
if i must fail the fault is yours not minethe nurse assumes the posture of a suppliant grasping phaedras hand and knees
phaedra
what seize my hand use force the suppliant grasp
nurse
yes and your knees too i shall not let go
phaedra
to learn the truth poor woman will be your doom
nurse
what doom is worse for me than losing you
phaedra
it will be your death to me the affair brings honor
nurse
why keep it hid then when my request is noble
phaedra
out of great shame i scheme to make great good
nurse
why speak it out then and youll be more honored
phaedra
i ask you by the gods be gone let go
nurse
no for you do not give the gift you ought
phaedra
i shall your suppliant hand commands my awe
nurse
im silent now the word henceforth is yours
phaedra
unhappy mother what a love you felt
nurse
for the cretan bull or what is this you mean
phaedra
and you poor sister dionysus bride
nurse
whats wrong with you daughter why defame your kin
phaedra
and i the third how wretchedly i perish
nurse
i am astonished where will these words lead
phaedra
from far back nothing recent is my woe
nurse
of what i wish to hear im no whit wiser
phaedra
oh could you but say the words that i must say
nurse
i am no seer to know whats hid from sight
phaedra
what is this thing they call ‘to be in love’
nurse
at once great pleasure daughter and great pain
phaedra
it is the second that i think is mine
nurse
what are you in love my child whos the man
phaedra
whatever his name is son of the amazon
nurse
you mean hippolytus
phaedra
yours are the words not mine
nurse
ah what can you mean my child this is my death women this is unendurable i can not endure
to live hateful to me is the day the light i see i shall throw myself down die and be quit of life farewell i am gone for the chaste they do not will it but yet tis so are in love with disaster aphrodite is not after all a goddess
but something even more mighty she has destroyed her me and the house
chorus
have you marked oh have you heard oh the queen uttering woes past hearing death take me my friend
before i come to share your thoughts ah me alas oh how unhappy these pains have made you oh the troubles that have mortals in their keeping you are undone you have revealed your miseries to the light of day the hours of this long day what awaits you in them
some unlucky change for the house will be brought to pass and it is now quite clear to what end the stroke sent by aphrodite is aimed o unhappy cretan girl
phaedra
phaedra
women of trozen dwellers in this extreme forecourt to the land of pelops
i have pondered before now in other circumstances in the nights long watches how it is that the lives of mortals are in ruins i think that it is not owing to the nature of their wits that they fare worse than they might since many people possess good sense rather one must look at it this way
we know and understand what is noble but do not bring it to completion some fail from laziness others because they give precedence to some other pleasure than being honorable lifes pleasures are many long leisurely talks a pleasant evil
and the sense of awe yet they are of two sorts one pleasure being no bad thing another a burden upon houses if propriety were always clear there would not be two things designated by the same letters since these are the views i happen to have arrived at beforehand there is no drug could make me
pervert them and reverse my opinion
i shall tell you also the road my thoughts took when love wounded me i considered how i might bear it most creditably my starting point was this to conceal my malady with silence
for the tongue is not to be trusted it knows well how to admonish the thoughts of others but gets from itself a great deal of trouble my second intention was to bear this madness nobly overcoming it by means of selfcontrol
but third when with these means i was unable to master aphrodite i resolved on death the best of plans as no one shall deny for just as i would not have my good deeds unknown so may i not have a throng of witnesses to my shameful ones
i knew that both the deed and the passionate longing for it were discreditable knew besides that i was a woman a thing all men hate damnation take the woman who first began to besmirch her marriagebed
with other men this contagion began for the female sex with the nobility for when those of high position resolve on dishonorable acts surely the lowly will regard them as noble but i also hate women who are chaste in word but in secret possess an ignoble daring
how o aphrodite lady of the sea how can these women look into the faces of their husbands how do they not fear that the darkness their accomplice and the timbers of the house will break into speech
my friends it is this very purpose that is bringing about my death
that i may not be detected bringing shame to my husband or to the children i gave birth to but rather that they may live in glorious athens as free men free of speech and flourishing enjoying good repute where their mother is concerned for it enslaves a man even if he is bold of heart
when he is conscious of sins committed by his mother or father only one thing they say competes in value with life the possession of a heart blameless and good but as for the base among mortals they are exposed late or soon by time who holds up to them as to a young girl
a mirror in their number may i never be found
chorus leader
oh what a fine thing is chastity everywhere and how splendid is the repute it gains among men
nurse
nurse
mistress though the misfortune you told me of gave me just now a momentary fright
yet now i realize that i was being simpleminded and among mortals second thoughts are i suppose wiser it is not anything extraordinary anything beyond all reckoning that has befallen you but it is the wrath of the goddess that has descended on you you are in love why is that so strange it is a condition you share with many
will you because of love destroy your own life those who are in love today or shall be tomorrow get little profit then if they must die for it aphrodite if she streams upon us in great force cannot be endured against those who yield to her demands she comes in mildness
but the one whom she finds to be high and proud such a one she takes and mistreats ever so badly
she moves through the air she dwells in the seawave and all that lives comes from her she it is that gives and implants love
that love of which all we of earth are begotten those who possess the writings of ancient poets and are themselves concerned with the muses know that zeus once lusted for semeles bed know too that dawn
goddess of lovely light once abducted cephalus to heaven for loves sake but these deities still continue to live in heaven and do not exile themselves from the sight of the gods they are resigned to their defeat by illfortune
but you will you not resign yourself to this your father then should have
begotten you on fixed terms or with a different set of gods in heaven if you are going to refuse acquiescence in these rules how many men do you think men well endowed with sense see their wives unfaithful and pretend to see nothing how many fathers do you think help to supply their wayward sons
with the pleasures of aphrodite this is one of the wise principles mortals follow dishonorable deeds should keep to the dark mortals should not you know try to bring to their lives too high a perfection no more would you make fine and exact the roof over a house but when you have tumbled into
misfortunes as great as yours how can you think you might swim out of them no if the good you have done outweighs the bad then by mortal reckoning you will be fortunate indeed
so my daughter leave off these wicked thoughts leave off this pride it is pride nothing else
to try to best the gods bear up under your love it was a god that willed it and if you are ill with it use some good measures to subdue it there are incantations and words that charm something will turn up to cure this love
men will be slow to invent such contrivances if we women do not find them
chorus leader
phaedra the advice she gives is more expedient in view of the disaster that is upon you but it is you that i praise yet this praise is a harder saying to you
than her speech and more painful for you to hear
phaedra
this is the thing that destroys the wellgoverned cities and houses of mortal men words that are too skilfully spoken words to delight the ear that is not at all what you must speak but rather such advice as brings a good name
nurse
why this high and haughty tone noblesounding words are not what you need but the man we must get things clear this instant and speak the forthright truth about you if your life were not in the grip of misfortunes like these and you were in fact a virtuous woman
i would not be leading you to this point merely for your sexual pleasure but as things stand the struggle is a great one to save your life and no one can begrudge us this course
phaedra
o monstrous wont you shut your mouth and cease from now on to utter such vile words
nurse
vile yes but better for you than your fine sentiments better the deed if it will save your life than the word you will plume yourself on and die
phaedra
do not by the gods （for your words are fair but their meaning base） do not i beg of you go any further my soul is all made ready
by desire and if you continue to urge dishonor with eloquence i shall be entirely spent on what i now flee
nurse
if that is what you wish then although you were better not to be erring yet if you are erring be ruled by me for that is the favor that is next best i have lovemedicine
within the house i just thought of it this very moment that will free you from this malady without disgrace to you or harm to your mind if only you do not flinch we must get some token from the man you love a lock of hair a piece of clothing
then compound from the twain a single blessing
phaedra
this drug is it an ointment or a potion
nurse
i know not strive for benefit not lore
phaedra
i fear youll prove too clever for my good
nurse
youd quake you know at shadows whats your fear
phaedra
your telling some word of this to theseus son
nurse
dismiss the thought my child i shall arrange this business well i wish only that you aphrodite lady of the sea may be my accomplice as for what else i have in mind it will be enough for me to tell our friends withinexit nurse into the palace
chorus
eros god of love distilling liquid desire down upon the eyes bringing sweet pleasure to the souls of those against whom you make war never to me may you show yourself to my hurt nor ever come but in due measure and harmony
for the shafts neither of fire nor of the stars exceed the shaft of aphrodite which eros zeuss son hurls forth from his hand
chorus
tis folly folly that the land of greece makes great the slaughter of cattle by the banks of the alpheus and in the pythian house of apollo if we pay no honor to eros mankinds despot who holds the keys
to the sweet chambers of aphrodite he ruins mortals and sets them upon all manner of disaster when he visits them
chorus
that filly in oechalia unjoined as yet to marriagebed unhusbanded unwed aphrodite took from the house of her father eurytus
and yoked her like a footloose naiad or a bacchant and gave her to the accompaniment of bloodshed and smoke with bloody bridal to alcmenes son o unhappy in her marriage
chorus
o holy fortress of thebes o mouth where dirces stream pours forth you could second my account of how aphrodite comes for she gave as bride to the blazing thunder
the mother of twiceborn bacchus and with bloody fate brought her to bed she is terrible her breath blows over all and she hovers flittingly like a beea shout within is heard phaedra rises from her couch and stands with her ear to the palace door
phaedra
silence women i am undone
chorus leader
what is there in the house to cause you fright
phaedra
be still let me hear the voice of those within
chorus leader
i hold my peace but what you say bodes ill
phaedra
oh alas alas
oh unhappy am i in my sufferings
chorus
what is the word you utter the message you cry out tell us what report is it that affrights you rushing upon your heart
phaedra
i am destroyed stand next to this door and listen what kind of din is being raised in the house
chorus
you are by the door tidings to be transmitted from the house are your concern
tell me tell me what disaster has come upon you
phaedra
it is hippolytus son of the horseloving amazon who shouts dreadfully upbraiding my servant
chorus
i hear a voice but what i have is not clear speech tell me what kind of cry it is that comes to you through the door
phaedra
its clear enough he calls her pander for the wicked
one who has betrayed her masters marriagebed
chorus
oh disaster you are betrayed my friend what can i do for you what was hidden is now revealed and you are ruined
oh ah betrayed by one close to you
phaedra
she has destroyed me by speaking of my troubles trying in kindness but dishonorably to heal this malady of mine
chorus leader
what then what will you do you that have suffered things past all contrivance
phaedra
i know but one thing to die with all speed
the sole remedy for my present troublesexit phaedra into the palace enter from the palace hippolytus followed by the nurse
hippolytus
o earth my mother o bright and open sunlight what unspeakable words i have heard
nurse
silence my son before your shout is heard
hippolytus
i have heard dread things i cannot now be silent
nurse
she kneels as a suppliant before hippolytus and tries to grasp his hand
do so i beg you by your fair right hand
hippolytus
keep your hands from me do not touch my cloak
nurse
i beg you by your knees do not destroy me
hippolytus
what didnt you say your tale was not so bad
nurse
its words my son are not for the ears of all
hippolytus
fine tales make finer telling to many hearers
nurse
my child i beg you do not break your oath
hippolytus
it was my tongue that swore it not my mind
nurse
son what will you do destroy those near to you
hippolytus

pah no criminal shall be near and dear to me
nurse
forgive to err is mankinds lot my son
hippolytus
hippolytus
o zeus why have you settled women in the light of the sun women this bane mankind find counterfeit if you wished to propagate the human race it was not from women that you should have given us this
rather men should have put down in the temples either bronze or iron or a mass of gold and have bought offspring each man for a price corresponding to his means and then dwelt in houses free from the female sex
but as matters stand when we are about to take unto ourselves a bane we pay out the wealth of our homes the clear proof that woman is a great bane is this her father who begat her and raised her adds a dowry to her and thus sends her off in order to be quit of a trouble
but her husband who has taken this creature of ruin into his house takes pleasure in adding finery to the statue lovely finery to a statue most worthless and tricks her out with garments wretch that he is destroying by degrees the wealth of his house there is a fatal necessity either a man makes a good connection by marriage
and his joy in his inlaws makes him preserve a marriagerelation that gives him pain or he gets a good wife and bad inlaws and keeps in check his unhappiness with his blessing
but the man with a nullity for a wife he has it easy although a woman who sits in a house and is a fool is a trouble
but a clever woman that i loathe may there never be in my house a woman with more intelligence than befits a woman for aphrodite engenders more mischief in the clever the woman without ability is kept from indiscretion by the slenderness of her wit
one ought to let no slave pass in to see a woman rather one should companion them with wild and brute beasts so that they would be unable either to speak to anyone or to be spoken to in return but as things are the wicked ones plot evil
within doors and their servants carry their plans abroad
it is in this fashion loathesome creature that you have come to traffic with me in the sacred bed of my father i shall pour running water into my ears to wash away your proposals how could you think me such a traitor
since the very sound of such things makes me feel unclean i tell you plainly it is my piety that saves you woman for if i had not been off my guard and trapped by an oath in the name of the gods i would not forbear to tell this whole story to my father but as it is while theseus is out of the country
i shall leave the house and hold my tongue but i shall return with my father and then see how you look upon him you and your mistress i shall know your boldness having had experience of it a curse on you all i shall never take my fill of hating
women not even if someone says that i am always talking of it for they too are always in some way evil let a man accordingly either teach them to be chaste or allow me to tread upon them foreverexit hippolytus by eisodos b

how luckless how illstarred is the fate of women
what arts do we have what speech once we have faltered that can undo the knot our words have created i have received my just deserts ho earth ho light of the sun how shall i escape what has befallen how hide the painful fact my friends
what god what mortal shall appear to help me sit at my side and lend hand to my unjust deeds for my present misfortune crosses now unhappy the crossing to the farther bourne of life unluckiest am i of womenenter phaedra from the palace
chorus leader
oh dear all is over mistress and the designs of your servant have not succeeded all is lost
phaedra
vile destroyer of your friends see what you have done to me may zeus the father of my race destroy you root and branch with his thunderbolt
did i not warn you did i not guess your purpose to say nothing of the matters now causing me disgrace but you could not bear to do so and so i shall no longer die with an honorable name i must plan anew for he with his mind whetted to a fine edge with anger
will utter against my name the wrongs you have committed  he will tell pittheus of my misfortune and will fill the whole land with ugly tales my curse on you and on anyone who itches to perform for friends unwilling services that are dishonorable
nurse
mistress you can to be sure find fault with the troubles i have brought you for the sting of them controls your reason but if you will hear it i too have something to say in reply i brought you up and wish your good when i looked to find a remedy for your malady what i found was not what i wanted
but if i had had success i would have been numbered among the very wise for our reputation for wisdom varies with the outcome
phaedra
what is this justice and satisfaction for me to run me through and then to admit you are wrong
nurse
we are wasting words i admit i went too far
but even from this my child you can escape with your life
phaedra
no more from you for last time the advice you gave was dishonorable and what you attempted to do was criminal get out of my way and worry about yourself my own business i shall myself arrange well
exit the nurse into the palace
noble women of trozen grant me this one request bury in silence what you have heard this day
chorus leader
i swear by artemis the holy zeuss daughter that i shall never reveal to the daylight any of your troubles
phaedra
it is good i have one further thing to add i have discovered a means for coping with this disaster so that i may bequeath to my sons a life of good repute and myself win some benefit in the face of present events for i shall never disgrace my cretan home
nor shall i go to face theseus with shameful deeds charged against me if only one life stands in the way
chorus leader
what harm past cure is it you mean to do
phaedra
to die but the manner of it that shall be my devising
chorus leader
say no more shocking words
phaedra
and you give me advice that is good
this day i shall delight aphrodite who is bent on destroying me when i have taken leave of my life and i shall fall as victim to a hateful passion but to someone else i shall prove a bane by my death so that he may learn not to wax proud

would that i could flee to secret clefts in the high mountains and that there a god might make of me a feathered bird amid the wingèd throngs
would that i might soar aloft over the surf of the adriatic shore and the waters of the eridanus where into the deepblue swell the luckless
girls in grief for phaethon drop the amber radiance of their tears

to glorious athens and they tied the plaited ends of the mooringcable on munichus shore and trod the mainland
chorus
therefore her mind is wrenched
by a terrible malady of unhallowed passion sent from aphrodite and sinking under a load of hard misfortune she will fasten about her from the beams of her bridal chamber

chorus
unhappy man great is the grief your house holds my eyes are drenched with tears and melt at your misfortune

theseus
whats this what can it be this tablet hanging from her dear hand does it want to tell me of something i do not know has the poor woman written me a message of entreaty about our marriage and children
fear not poor woman there is no woman who shall take possession of the bed and house of theseus he takes up the tablet  see the impress of the dead womans goldchased seal attracts my eyes come let me open its sealed wrappings

bystanders enter quickly by eisodos b and gather around
hippolytus has dared to put his hand by force to my marriagebed dishonoring the holy eye of zeus
but father poseidon with one of the three curses you once promised me kill my son and may he not live out
this day if indeed you have granted me curses i may rely on
chorus leader
my lord i beg you by the gods take back your prayer for you will learn in time that you have made a mistake be ruled by me
theseus
it cannot be and what is more i shall banish him from this land and of two fates one shall strike him
either poseidon honoring my curses will send him dead to the house of hades or being banished from here he will wander over foreign soil and drain to the dregs a life of miseryenter hippolytus by eisodos b
chorus leader
look your son hippolytus is here himself a timely arrival
abate your harsh anger my lord theseus and think what is best for your house
hippolytus
i heard your cry and came in haste father but what it was that brought forth your groan i know not but would gladly hear from your lips
he sees the corpse of phaedra
but what can this be i see your wife father dead this is matter for gravest wonder just now i left her and it was no long time ago that she was looking on this light of day what has happened to her how did she die
father i want to learn this from you theseus is silent  what silent silence is no use in misfortune for the heart that longs to hear all things is proved greedy in misfortune as well it is not right to keep your troubles from your kin
no more than kin father
theseus
o foolish mankind so often missing the mark why do you teach crafts numberless and contrive and invent all things when there is one thing you do not understand and have not hunted after
how to teach the senseless to be sensible
hippolytus
a formidable expert this who is able to force insensate fools to show sense but since these finespun disputations of yours father are unseasonable i fear that your misfortunes have caused your tongue to run amok
theseus
ah but there ought to be for mortals some reliable test for friends some way to know their minds which of them is a true friend and which is not and each man ought to have two voices the one a voice of justice the other whatever he chanced to have
so that the voice that thinks unjust thoughts would be convicted of falsehood by the just voice and in this way we should never be deceived
hippolytus
but has one of my kin been slandering me in your ear and are my fortunes diseased though i have done nothing amiss i am astonished
your words cast adrift from all sense astonish me
theseus
oh the heart of mortals how far will it go what limit can be set to hardihood and brazenness if it grows great in the course of a mans life and the man who comes after shall overtop his predecessor
in knavery the gods will have to add another earth to our world to hold the criminal and the vile
look at this man he was born from my loins and yet he disgraced my bed and is clearly convicted
of utter baseness by the dead woman here
hippolytus turns away
come show your face to your father eye to eye since in any case i have already involved myself in pollution are you then the companion of the gods as a man beyond the common are you the chaste one untouched by evil
i will never be persuaded by your vauntings never be so unintelligent as to impute folly to the gods continue then your confident boasting take up a diet of greens and play the showman with your food make orpheus your lord and engage in mystic rites holding the vaporings of many books in honor
for you have been found out to all i give the warning avoid men like this for they make you their prey with their highholysounding words while they contrive deeds of shame
she is dead do you think this will save you this is the fact that most serves to convict you villainous man
for what oaths what arguments could be more powerful than she is to win you acquittal on the charge will you claim that she hated you and that the bastard is always regarded as an enemy to the trueborn it is a poor merchant of her own life you make her then
if she destroyed what was most precious to herself for enmity of you but will you say that folly is not to be found in men but is native to women i know that young men are no more stable than women when aphrodite stirs their young hearts to confusion
but their standing as males steads them well
and so now but why do i wage this contest against your speech when this corpse witness most reliable lies near go forth from this land with all speed as an exile and come no more either to godbuilt athens
or to the borders of any land ruled by my spear for if i am to be bested by you when you have done this to me isthmian sinis shall no longer attest that i killed him but say it was an idle boast and the skironian rocks near the sea
shall deny that i am a scourge to evildoers
chorus leader
i know not how i might say that any mortal enjoys good fortune for all that is noblest is now overthrown
hippolytus
hippolytus
father the anger and vehemence of your heart is dreadful yet though the case you argue provides such fine words
it is not fine in fact if one should examine it closely i am not skilful to make a speech to a crowd but have more ability to address my agemates and the few （this too is right and proper for those who are of no account among the wise are often more inspired speakers before the multitude）
yet since disaster has come upon me i must loosen my tongue i shall begin to speak from the point where you first attacked me expecting you would destroy me with not a word to say in reply you see the light of the son you see the earth upon this sunlit earth there is no man
though you deny it more chaste than i i know how to reverence the gods and how to make friends who do not try to commit wrong friends who scruple to give evil orders and to render base services to those about them
i am no mocker of my companions father but the same man to friends both absent and present one thing has not touched me that wherein you think you have convicted me to this very moment my body is pure of the bed of love i do not know this act save by report
or seeing it in painting i am not eager to look at it either since i have a virgin soul
but suppose that my chastity does not persuade you of my innocence i waive the point you ought to show how i was corrupted did her body surpass all other womens
in beauty or did i hope that by taking an heiress to bed i would succeed to your house i was foolish then nay completely out of my mind but will you say that to be king is a tempting pleasure even to the virtuous not so at all since kingly power has corrupted
the minds of all those who love it i for my part would wish to be first at the greek games but in the city to be second and to enjoy continuous good fortune with my noble friends for not only is there scope for action but also the absence of danger
yields a greater pleasure than being king
i have said all else one more point remains if i had a witness to what manner of man i am and if i were pleading my case while she was still alive your careful investigation would have discovered in very truth who the guilty party is
as things stand i swear by zeus god of oaths and by the earth beneath me that i never put my hand to your wife never wished to never had the thought may i perish with no name or reputation citiless homeless wandering the earth an exile
and may neither sea nor earth receive my body when i am dead if i am guilty what the fear was that made her take her life i do not know for i am not at liberty to speak further virtue she showed though she did not possess it
while i who had it did not use it well
chorus leader
you have made a sufficient rebuttal of the charge against you by giving your oath in the name of the gods which is no slight assurance
theseus
is this man not a chanter of spells and a charlatan he is confident that by his calm temper
he will overmaster my soul though he has dishonored the father who begat him
hippolytus
i feel the same great wonder at you father for if you were my son and i your father i would not have banished but killed you if you had dared to put your hand to my wife
theseus
how like you these words are not thus will you die according to the rule you have just laid down for yourself for a swift death is a mercy for a wretch but going as a wanderer from your ancestral land over foreign soil you will drain to the dregs a life of misery
for that is the penalty for an impious man
hippolytus
alas what do you mean to do will you not even receive the witness of time in my case but banish me from the land
theseus
yes beyond the euxine sea and the pillars of atlas if i could such is my hatred of you
hippolytus
will you not examine my oath and sworn testimony or the words of seers will you banish me without a trial
theseus
theres no divinatory chanciness about this tablet and its accusation against you deserves my trust as for the birds that fly above my head i bid them a long farewell
hippolytus
o gods why do i not then open my mouth seeing that i am being done to death by you towards whom i am showing piety but no i would not convince those i must and i would break the oath i swore to no purpose
theseus
oh your highandholy manner will be the death of me
wont you leave your fathers land at once
hippolytus
where am i to turn unhappy man that i am what guestfriends house shall i enter when i am exiled on this charge
theseus
someone doubtless that enjoys taking in as guests men to defile their wives and men who keep at home plotting evil
hippolytus
oh that stroke cut me to the heart it is nearly enough to make me weep if i am regarded as base and seem so to you
theseus
groans and forethought would have been in place when you had the hardihood to commit outrage against your fathers wife
hippolytus
o house would that you could utter speech on my behalf
and bear me witness whether i am base
theseus
how clever of you to take refuge in witnesses that are dumb while the facts with mute eloquence betray your baseness
hippolytus
oh oh would that i could stand apart and look at myself so that i might weep at the misfortunes i am suffering
theseus
you are far more practiced in worshipping yourself than in being just and acting piously toward your father
hippolytus
o unhappy mother o birth that gave no pleasure may no one i love ever be a bastard
theseus
will you not drag him away servants have you not heard
me proclaim for a long time that this man is no citizen here
hippolytus
any of them who touches me shall regret it rather you yourself if you have the heart to thrust me forth from the land
theseus
i shall do so if you do not obey my words for i am not moved by pity for your exile
hippolytus
the sentence is fixed it seems o how luckless i am seeing that i know the truth but not how i may tell it dearest of gods to me artemis letos child you i have sat with you i have hunted with i shall leave glorious athens as an exile now farewell city
and land of erechtheus o land of trozen how many blessings you possess to pass ones youth in farewell this is my last look at you and my last greeting
come you my agemates of this land bid me farewell and send me forth from the land
for you will never see a man more chaste than i even though my father thinks not soexit hippolytus and the young members of the crowd by eisodos a exit theseus into the palace
chorus
thoughts about the gods when they come into my mind are banished by painful understanding
what hope is there left to see their hidden workings in the fortunes and doings of mortals for from one quarter comes one thing and from another another and mens life is a shifting thing
ever unstable
chorus
o that in answer to my prayer fate might give me this gift from the gods a lot of blessedness and a heart untouched by sorrow
no mind unswerving and obdurate would i have nor yet again one falsestruck but changing my pliant character ever for the morrow i would share the morrows happiness my whole life through
chorus
for my mind is no longer untroubled but beyond all expectation are the things i look upon we have seen greeces fairest star have seen him go forth sped by his fathers wrath
to another land o sands of our citys shore o mountain thickets where with his swift hounds he slew the wild beasts
in company with holy dictynna
chorus
no more shall you mount behind a pair of enetic horses and take the racecourse about the mere with the feet of your racing steeds
the music that never slept beneath the frame of the lyrestrings shall cease in your fathers house bare of garlands will be the restingplaces of letos daughter in the deep greenwood
the rivalry of maidens to be your bride has been brought to an end by your exile
chorus
but i for my part will spread abroad your unhappy fate with tears at your misfortune o unhappy mother
it was to no purpose that you bore him oh i am angry with the gods ye graces that dance your round why do you not accompany this man from this house he has been ruined by his fathers wrath
but is guiltless of no mad deed

i bring you news that deserves your concern and that of the citizens who dwell in athens and in the land of trozen

what is it has some fresh disaster seized the two neighboring cities
messenger
hippolytus is dead as good as dead though he still sees the light of day yet it will not take much to incline the balance the other way
theseus
who killed him did someone have a quarrel with him
whose wife he ravished as he did his fathers
messenger
his own chariot destroyed him and the curses of your mouth which you uttered against your son to your father lord of the sea
theseus
stretching out his arms palm upwards in prayer
merciful gods so you were after all truly my father poseidon
since you have heard my prayer how did he perish tell me how did zeuss cudgel strike him for dishonoring me
messenger
messenger
we were scraping and combing the horses coats near the wavebeaten shore and
weeping at our task for a messenger had come saying that hippolytus would no longer dwell in this land being exiled by you and he came singing the same tearful burden to join us at the shore and a countless throng
of friends and agemates at his heels came with him and when some time had passed he ceased his lamenting and said ‘why am i distraught at this i must obey my fathers words servants get the yokehorses ready for my chariot for this city is no longer mine’
thereupon every man worked in haste and more quickly than one could describe it we set the horses in their gear right beside the master he seized the reins from the chariotrail and fitted his feet right into the footstalls
first he spread his hands palms up in prayer to the gods and said ‘o zeus may i no longer live if i am guilty but whether i am dead or look on the light may my father come to know that he dishonors me’
so saying he took the whip into his hand and applied it
to his horses all together and we servants on the ground beside the chariot near the bridle accompanied our master along the road that makes straight for argos and epidaurus
when we struck deserted country there is a headland that lies beyond our territory
lying out towards what is at that point the saronic gulf there a great noise in the earth like zeuss thunder roared heavily it made one shudder to hear it the horses pricked up their heads and ears to heaven while we servants were taken with a violent fear
at the thought where this voice came from when we turned our eyes to the seabeaten beach we saw a wave immense and uncanny set fast in the sky so great that my eye was robbed of the sight of scirons coast and the isthmus and asclepius cliff were hid from view
and then as the seasurge made it swell and seeth up much foam all about it came toward the shore where the chariot was with its very swell and surge the wave put forth a bull fierce and heavensent
with its bellowing the whole land was filled and gave back unearthly echoes and as we looked on it the sight was too great for our eyes to bear at once a terrible panic fell upon the horses my master who had lived long with the ways of horses
seized the reins in his hands and pulled them letting his body hang backwards from the straps like a sailor pulling an oar but they took the firewrought bit in their teeth and carried him against his will paying no heed to their captains hand
or the harness or the tightglued chariot if he held the helm and directed their course toward the softer ground the bull appeared before him to turn them back maddening the team with fear
but if they rushed with maddened senses into the rocks it drew near and silently accompanied the chariot until it upset and overthrew the chariot striking its wheelrims on a rock all was confounded the wheels naves
and the axlepins were leaping into the air and the poor man himself entangled in the reins bound in a bond not easy to untie was dragged along smashing his head against the rocks and rending his flesh and uttering things dreadful to hear
‘stay horses my mangers have nourished do not blot me out o wretched curse of my father who wishes to stand by the best of men and save his life’
there were many of us who wished but we were outsped and our feet lagged behind he was cut loose from the reins of leather
and fell upon the ground i know not how with scarcely any breath of life still in him the horses vanished and so too did the monstrous bull to some place or other in that rocky land
i am i know a slave of your house my lord
but i shall never have the strength to believe that your son was guilty not even if the whole female sex should hang themselves and fill with writing all the pinewood that grows upon mount ida for i know that he was good
chorus leader
alas new misfortunes have been brought to pass and there is no escape from fate and destiny
theseus
for hatred of the man who has suffered these things i took pleasure at your words but now in respect for the gods and for this man since he is my son
i feel neither pleasure nor pain at these misfortunes
messenger
what then shall i do shall we bring the unhappy man here or what shall we do to please your heart
theseus
bring him so that i may look him in the face the man who denies he violated my bed and with my words and with the misfortunes sent by the gods give him the lieexit messenger by eisodos a

you carry along the unyielding hearts of the immortals aphrodite and the hearts of men and with you is he
of the manycolored wings surrounding them with his swift pinions eros flies over the earth and over the loudroaring salt sea and bewitches the one on whose frenzied mind he darts
winged and goldgleaming he bewitches the whelps of the mountain and those of the sea what the earth brings forth and what the blazing sun looks down upon
and likewise mortal men over all these aphrodite you alone hold your honored sway
artemis appears above the skene
artemis
noblyborn son of aegeus listen i order you
it is i artemis letos daughter who address you why unhappy man do you take joy in these things you have godlessly killed your son persuaded of things unseen by the false words of your wife but all too clearly seen is the ruin you have won for yourself
why do you not hide yourself beneath the earths depths in shame or change your life for that of a bird above and take yourself out of this pain for among good men
you possess no share in life
artemis
hear theseus the state of your misfortunes （and yet i accomplish nothing by this and merely cause you grief） but it was for this purpose that i came to make plain that your sons heart is guiltless so that he may die with a good name
make plain too the maddened frenzy of your wife or in some sort her nobility for she was stung by the goad of that goddess most hated by us who take pleasure in virginity and fell in love with your son and as she attempted to conquer aphrodite by her resolve
she was destroyed all unwitting by the contrivances of her nurse who told your son under oath of her malady he as in fact was right did not fall in with her words nor yet again did he break the firmness of his oath being pious though he was reviled by you
and phaedra fearing lest she be put to the proof wrote her false letter and destroyed your son by deceit and though it was a lie she persuaded you
theseus
o pain
artemis
does this tale sting you theseus hold your peace so that you may hear the sequel and groan the more
do you know that you possess three reliable curses from your father one of these you took base man to use against your son when you could have used it against an enemy your father the sealord kindly disposed as he was towards you granted what he had to grant seeing that he had made this promise
but in his sight and in mine you are proved base since you did not wait either for confirmation or for the word of a prophet you did not put the charge to the proof nor grant to time the right to investigate it but more rashly than you ought you let loose the curse upon your son and killed him
theseus
lady may i live no longer
artemis
you have done dreadful deeds but for all that it is still possible for you to win pardon for these things aphrodite willed that things should happen thus sating her anger among the gods the custom is this no god contrives to cross
the will of another but we all stand aside for be in no doubt if it were not that i feared zeus i would never have come to such a pitch of shame as to allow the death of the man i love most among mortals ignorance acquits
your misdoings of baseness and further the death of your wife made impossible the testing of her words and thus she persuaded your mind
chiefly upon you do these misfortunes break but i too feel grief for the gods do not rejoice
at the death of the godly but the wicked we destroy children house and allenter hippolytus by eisodos a supported by his servants

but you child of old aegeus take your son in your arms and embrace him for you were not responsible for killing him and when the gods so send it is understandable that men make fatal errors
as for you hippolytus i urge you not to hate your father for the manner of your death has been fated farewell it is not lawful for me to look upon the dead or to defile my sight with the last breath of the dying and i see that you are already near that misfortune
