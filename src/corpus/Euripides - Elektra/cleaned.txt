before the hut of the peasant in the country on the borders of argolis it is just before sunrise the peasant is discovered alone
peasant

o ancient plain of land the streams of inachus from which king agamemnon once mounted war on a thousand ships and sailed to the land of troy after he had slain priam the ruler of ilium
and captured the famous city of dardanus he came here to argos and set up on the high temples many spoils of the barbarians and in troy he was successful but at home he died by the guile of his wife clytemnestra
and the hand of aegisthus son of thyestes and he left behind the ancient scepter of tantalus and is dead but aegisthus rules the land possessing agamemnons wife the daughter of tyndareus now as for those whom he left in his house when he sailed to troy
his son orestes and his young daughter electra when orestes was about to die at the hand of aegisthus his fathers old servant stole him away and gave him to strophius to bring up in the land of the phocians electra stayed in her fathers house
and when she came to the blooming season of youth the foremost suitors of the land of hellas asked for her in marriage but aegisthus feared she might bear to some chieftain a son who would avenge agamemnon and so he kept her at home and did not betroth her to any bridegroom
when even this filled him with great fear that she might secretly bear children to some noble lord aegisthus planned to kill her but her mother although cruel at heart rescued her from his hand for she had a pretext for having slain her husband
but she feared that she would be despised for the murder of her children so then for these reasons aegisthus devised such a scheme he promised gold to anyone who should kill agamemnons son who had left the country as an exile while electra he gave
in marriage to me my ancestors were mycenaeans in that respect at least i am not to blame my family was noble in race but poor in money which is the ruin of good birth he gave her to a powerless man so that his fear might lose its power
for if some man of high position got her he would have roused the sleeping blood of agamemnon and judgment would have come at some time to aegisthus but i have never （cypris knows this too） dishonored her in bed she is still a virgin indeed
i am ashamed to have the daughter of a wealthy man and violate her when i was not born of equal rank and i groan for the wretched orestes called my kinsman if he shall ever return to argos and see the unfortunate marriage of his sister
and whoever says i am a fool if i do not touch a young girl when i have her in my house let him know that he measures soundness of mind by worthless standards of judgment and he himself is a fool
electra enters from the hut carrying a water pitcher on her head she is dressed in rags
electra
o black night nurse of the golden stars
in which i go to the rivers streams bearing this pitcher resting on my head not because i have come to such a point of necessity but so that i may show to the gods aegisthus insolence and send forth laments into the wide sky to my father
for the deadly daughter of tyndareus my mother has cast me out of the house to please her husband since she has borne other children in her union with aegisthus she considers orestes and me secondary in the home
peasant
why unhappy one do you do this work laboring for my sake
though you were well brought up before and do not stop even when i tell you this
electra
i hold you equal to the gods in kindness for in my distress you have not insulted me it is a great allotment for mortals
to find a healer for ill fortune such as i have in you and so even though unbidden i ought to share your labors relieving you of work as far as i have strength so that you may bear it more easily you have enough to do outside i must keep the house
in order it is pleasant for the worker coming in from outside to find things within right
peasant
go then if you wish and in fact the springs are not far from my house when it is day i will drive the oxen to my lands and sow the fields
for no idler though he has the gods names always on his lips can gather a livelihood without hard workelectra and the peasant go out a moment later orestes and pylades enter
orestes
pylades i hold you first among men as a kind and trusted friend to me you alone of my friends have honored me orestes
being as i am in dreadful suffering from aegisthus who killed my father he and my most deadly mother i have come from the mystic shrine of the god to argive land and no one knows it to repay my fathers murderers with murder
during this past night going to my fathers tomb i wept and cut off a lock of my hair as an offering and sacrificed over the altar the blood of a slaughtered sheep unnoticed by the tyrants who rule this land and now i do not set foot within the walls
but i have come to the borders of this land combining two desires i may escape to another country if anyone on the watch should recognize me and looking for my sister （for they say that she lives here joined in marriage and is no longer a virgin）
i may meet with her and having her as an accomplice for murder i may learn clearly what is happening within the walls
and now since dawn is lifting up her bright eye let us step aside from this path for either some plowman or serving maid
will come in our sight from whom we may ask if my sister lives in this place but now that i see this maidservant bearing a weight of water on her shorn head let us sit down and inquire
of this slave girl if we may receive some word about the matter pylades for which we have come to this landthey step back a little as electra returns from the spring
electra
hasten your step it is time go onward onward weeping ah me
i am agamemnons child and clytemnestra hated daughter of tyndareus bore me the citizens call me unhappy electra
alas for my cruel pain and hateful life o father agamemnon you lie in hades by the butchery of your wife and aegisthus
electra
come waken the same lament take up the enjoyment of long weeping
electra
hasten your step it is time go onward onward weeping ah me
in what city and what household do you wander about my wretched brother leaving your pitiable sister in our ancestral home to great pain
come to me the unhappy one as a deliverer from this pain oh zeus zeus and as a defender for my father against his most hateful bloodshed bring the wanderer to shore in argos
electra
take this pitcher from my head and put it down so that i may cry aloud the nighttime laments for my father a wail a song of death of death for you father under the earth i speak the laments
in which i am always engaged day by day tearing my skin with my nails and striking my cropped head with my hand for your death
electra
oh oh tear my face as a clearsounding swan beside the rivers streams calls to its dearest father dying in the crafty snares of the
net so i lament you my unhappy father
electra
washed by the very last bath in the most piteous bed of death oh me
your bitter cleaving by the axe father the bitter plans of the way from troy your wife welcomed you with no victors garlands or crowns but with a twoedged sword
making you the mournful victim of aigisthus she got a treacherous bedfellow
the chorus of argive countrywomen enter
chorus
o electra daughter of agamemnon i have come to your rustic courtyard a milkdrinker from mycenae has come he has come
a mountain walker he reports that the argives are proclaiming a sacrifice for the third day from now and that all maidens are to go to heras temple
electra
my unhappy heart beats fast friends but not at adornment or gold nor will i set up choruses with the maidens of argos
and beat my foot in the mazes of the dance by tears i pass the night tears are my unhappy care day by day see if my filthy hair
and the rags of my dress will be fit for a princess a daughter of agamemnon or for troy once taken which remembers my father
chorus
mighty is the goddess come then and borrow from me thickwoven clothes to wear and gold as a favor to me accessories to adornment do you think to rule over your enemies by tears if you do not revere the gods
honoring the gods not by lamentation but by prayers you will have good fortune child
electra
no god attends to the voice of the illfated one
or to the slaying of my father long ago alas for the dead and for the living vagabond who dwells in another land somewhere
miserably wandering to a slaves hearth yet born of that renowned father i myself live in a poor mans house wasting my life away an exile from my fathers house
on the mountain crags but my mother with a new husband makes her home in a bed stained by blood
chorus leader
helen your mothers sister is the cause of many evils to the hellenes and to your house
electra
catching sight of orestes and pylades
ah women i have broken off my lament strangers who had their lair at the altar are rising from ambush towards the household let us escape the villains by flight you along the path and i to the house
orestes
stay poor girl do not fear my hand
electra
o phoebus apollo i beseech you to spare my life
orestes
may i kill others more hated than you
electra
go away do not touch one whom you must not touch
orestes
there is no one i have a better right to touch
electra
then why are you in ambush with drawn sword near my house
orestes
wait and hear and you will soon say the same
electra
i am still in any case i am yours since you are the stronger
orestes
i have come to bring you word from your brother
electra
oh best of friends is he alive or dead
orestes
alive for i want to tell you the good news first
electra
may you be happy as a reward for your most welcome tidings
orestes
i give that blessing for us two to have in common
electra
where does the unhappy one live in his unhappy exile
orestes
he goes miserably about not following the customs of any one city
electra
surely he does not want for a living day by day
orestes
he has that but an exile is a helpless man at best
electra
what is this message you have come bringing from him
orestes
if you are alive and if so how you are
electra
well then you see first of all how withered my body is
orestes
yes so wasted with sorrow that i sigh for it
electra
and my head and hair close shaven as if by a scythians razor
orestes
your brother and your dead father perhaps gnaw at your heart
electra
alas for what is dearer to me than they
orestes
ah what are you to your brother do you think
electra
he is far away not here to be my friend
orestes
why are you living here far from the city
electra
i am married stranger a deadly match
orestes
i pity your brother is your husband a mycenaean
electra
not one to whom my father ever hoped to give me
orestes
tell me so that i may hear and inform your brother
electra
i live in his house at a distance from the city
orestes
a ditchdigger or a herdsman is worthy of the house
electra
he is a man poor but noble and respectful to me
orestes
what is this respect that your husband has
electra
he has never dared to touch me in bed
orestes
does he hold some form of religious chastity or does he think you unworthy
electra
he did not think himself worthy to insult my family
orestes
and how was he not delighted to make such a marriage
electra
he thinks the person who gave me did not have that right stranger
orestes
i understand he fears that he may someday be punished by orestes
electra
he does fear that but he is also a virtuous man
orestes
ah you have described a noble man and he must be treated well
electra
yes if ever the one now absent comes home
orestes
but did your mother who gave you birth endure this
electra
women love their husbands stranger not their children
orestes
why did aegisthus insult you in this way
electra
he planned for me to bear powerless children when he gave me to such a man
orestes
so that you might not bear sons to punish him of course
electra
that was his plan may he make amends to me for it
orestes
does your mothers husband know that you are a virgin
electra
he does not know we steal that from him by our silence
orestes
are these women who hear our talk friends of yours
electra
they will keep both your words and mine well hidden
orestes
what then could orestes do in this matter if he comes to argos
electra
do you ask this you have said a shameful word isnt it the critical time now
orestes
but if he does come how might he kill his fathers murderers
electra
by daring such things as his enemies dared against my father
orestes
and would you dare with him to kill your mother
electra
yes with that same axe by which my father died
orestes
am i to tell him this and that your purpose is steadfast
electra
once i had shed my mothers blood i might die
orestes
ah would that orestes were near by to hear that
electra
but stranger i would not know him if i saw him
orestes
no wonder for you were both young when you were parted
electra
there is only one of my friends who would recognize him
orestes
the man who is said to have stolen him away from murder
electra
yes the old man my fathers old servant
orestes
did the dead man your father find burial
electra
he found what he could cast out of the house
orestes
alas the things you have said for perception of suffering even anothers gnaws at mortals speak so that when i know i may tell your brother the story unpleasant but necessary to hear pity is not present at all in ignorance
but in wise men and indeed it is not without penalty for the wise to have overly profound thoughts
chorus leader
and i have the same desire in my heart as this man being far from the town i do not know the citys troubles and now i want to learn them
electra
i will speak if i must and one must speak to a friend about my own and my fathers heavy misfortunes since you are setting the tale in motion i entreat you stranger tell orestes of our sorrows mine and his first of all in what clothes i live like a beast in a stall
with what filth i am weighted down under what roof i dwell having lived in a royal home i myself working hard on my clothes at the loom or else i shall go barely clad and do without always carrying water from the springs myself
with no share in the festival rites no part in the dance i turn away from married women as a virgin and i turn away from castor who sought me in marriage before he joined the gods for i was his relative but my mother in the spoils of troy
is seated on her throne and at her chair stand slaves from asia my fathers plunder fastening their trojan robes with golden brooches and still my fathers blood has rotted black on the wall while the one who killed him
mounts the same chariot and goes forth and is proud to hold in his bloodstained hands the scepter with which my father used to command the hellenes agamemnons grave dishonoured has not yet ever received any libations or branch of myrtle
but his altar is barren of ornament that famous one my mothers husband leaps on the grave they say when soaked in drink and pelts my fathers marble monument with stones and dares to say this to us
where is your son orestes is he here to defend the tomb for you nobly orestes is insulted in this way while absent
but stranger i beg you report these things there are many calling him to come i am their interpreter these hands this tongue my broken heart
my shorn head and his own father for it is shameful if his father destroyed the trojans but orestes is unable to kill a man one against one being young and born from a more noble father
chorus leader
and look i see him i mean your husband
on his way home having left his work
peasant
entering and catching sight of strangers talking to electra
oh who are these strangers i see at my door why have they come here to my rustic gate do they want something from me for it is shameful for a woman to be standing with young men
electra
dearest do not be suspicious of me you shall hear the truth for these strangers have come to me as messengers of news from orestes but strangers pardon him for what he said
peasant
what do they say the man is alive and sees the light of day
electra
he is at least in their report and i believe them
peasant
surely then he remembers something of your fathers wrongs and your own
electra
these are things to hope for a man in exile is powerless
peasant
what message from orestes have they come to declare
electra
he sent them as spies of my wrongs
peasant
then they see a part of it and perhaps you are telling them the rest
electra
they know they have all these things in abundance
peasant
then shouldnt you have opened the doors to them long before go into the house for in return for your good tidings you shall find as much hospitality as my house holds in store
servants take their baggage within the house do not contradict me since you are friends coming from a friend for even if i am poor i will not display manners that are illbred
orestes
by the gods is this the man who makes a fraud of your marriage
because he does not want to shame orestes
electra
this is the one who is called my husband unhappy as i am
orestes
ah there is no exact way to test a mans worth for human nature has confusion in it i have seen before now the son of a noble father
worth nothing and good children from evil parents famine in a rich mans spirit and a mighty soul in a poor mans body how then does one rightly distinguish and judge these things by wealth a sorry test to use
or by those who have nothing but poverty has a disease it teaches a man to be wicked in his need but shall i turn to warfare who facing the enemys spear could be a witness as to who is brave it is best to leave these matters alone at random
for this man neither important in argos nor puffed up by the good reputation of his family but one of the many has been found to be the best do not be foolish you who wander about full of empty notions but judge those noble among men by their company
and by their habits for such men rule well both states and homes while those bodies that are empty of mind are only ornaments in the marketplace for the strong arm does not await the battle any better than the weak
this depends on natural courage
but since agamemnons son both present and not present for whose sake we have come is worthy of it let us accept a lodging in this house calling to his servants  we must go within this house slaves may a man poor
but eager be a better host for me than a rich man and so i am content with the reception into this mans house though i would have wanted your brother in good fortune to lead me to his fortunate home perhaps he may come the oracles of loxias are
sure but human prophecy i dismiss
orestes pylades and their attendants go into the hut
chorus leader
now more than before electra i feel the warmth of joy at my heart for perhaps good fortune advancing with difficulty might come to a good restingplace
electra
o reckless man why knowing the poverty of your house
did you welcome these strangers greater than you
peasant
what if they are really as noble as they seem wont they be equally content among great and small
electra
since you one of the small have now made this error go to my fathers dear old servant
who tends his flocks an outcast from the city by the river tanaus which cuts a boundary between argive land and the land of sparta bid him come since these men have arrived at my house and provide something for the guests meal
he will be glad and will offer prayers to the gods when he hears that the child whom he once saved is alive i cannot get anything from my mother or from my fathers house for we would bring bitter news if she the hardhearted were to learn that orestes is still alive
peasant
i will take this message to the old man if you wish but go inside the house at once and make things ready there surely a woman if she wants to can find many additions to a meal  really there is still enough in the house
to cram them with food for one day at least it is in such cases whenever i fail in my intentions that i see how wealth has great power to give to strangers and to expend in curing the body when it falls sick but money for our daily food
comes to little for every man when full rich or poor gets an equal amountthe peasant departs as electra enters the hut
chorus
o famous ships you that once with countless oars went to troy conducting dances with the nereids
where the musicloving dolphin leapt and rolled at your darkblue prows bringing achilles the son of thetis light in the leap of his foot
with agamemnon to the banks of trojan simois
chorus
the nereids leaving euboeas headlands brought from hephaestus anvil his shieldwork of golden armor
up to pelion and the glens at the foot of holy ossa the nymphs watchtower    where his father the horseman was training the son of thetis as a light for hellas
seaborn swiftfooted for the sons of atreus
chorus
i heard from someone who had arrived at the harbor of nauplia from ilium that
on the circle of your famous  shield o son of thetis were wrought these signs a terror to the phrygians on the surrounding base of the shields rim perseus the throatcutter over
the sea with winged sandals was holding the gorgons body with hermes zeus messenger the rustic son of maia
chorus
in the center of the shield the suns bright circle
was shining on winged horses and the heavenly chorus of stars pleiades hyades bringing defeat to the eyes of hector
and upon his goldforged helmet were sphinxes bearing in their talons prey from singing on his breastplate a lioness breathing flame was eager in flight with her claws
seeing the colt of pirene
chorus
on the bloody hilt fourfooted horses were prancing while over their backs black dust rose up but your adultery killed the lord of such mighty warriors
evilminded daughter of tyndareus for this the gods of heaven will one day send you to death
truly the day will come when i shall see under your red throat blood gushing forth at the sword
the old man the former servant of agamemnon enters out of breath electra presently appears at the door of the hut
old man
where where is my young queen and mistress agamemnons child whom i once brought up how steep is the approach to her house
for a wrinkled old man to ascend with this foot still for these friends i must drag along my back bent double and sinking knees
oh daughter for i see you now before the house i have come bringing you from my own sheep
this newborn nursling of the flock having drawn it away from its mother and garlands and cheeses i have taken from the press and this old treasure of dionysus furnished with fragrance small but sweet to pour a cup of it into a weaker drink
let some one carry these gifts into the house for the guests i have moistened my eyes with tears and wish to wipe them off on this shred of my robe
electra
why are your eyes wet old man have my troubles stirred your memory after an interval of time
or are you groaning over the sad exile of orestes and over my father whom you once held in your arms and brought up in vain for you and for your friends
old man
in vain but still i could not endure this for i came to his grave an addition to my journey
and falling on it i wept for its desolation then i opened the wineskin which i am bringing to the guests and poured a libation and set myrtlesprigs round the tomb on the alter itself i saw a blackfleeced ram as an offering and there was blood not long poured out
and severed locks of yellow hair and i wondered child who ever dared come to the the tomb for it was no argive at least but perhaps your brother has somehow come secretly and on his return has done honor to his fathers wretched grave
go look to see if the color of the cut lock is the same as yours putting it to your own hair it is usual for those who have the same paternal blood to have a close resemblance in many features
electra
old man your words are unworthy of a wise man
if you think my own brave brother would come to this land secretly for fear of aegisthus then how will a lock of hair correspond the one made to grow in the wrestling schools of a wellbred man the other a womans lock by combing no it is impossible
but you could find in many people hair very similar although they are not of the same blood old man
old man
then stand in the footprint and see if the tread of the boot will measure with your own foot child
electra
how could there be an imprint of feet on a stony plot of ground
and if there is the foot of brother and sister would not be the same in size for the male conquers
old man
there is not even if your brother coming to this land       by which you might know your looms weaving
in which i once stole him away from death
electra
dont you know that i was still young when orestes was driven out of the land and even if i had woven him a robe how could he a child then have the same one now unless his clothes grew together with his body
but either a stranger taking pity on his grave
old man
where are the guests i want to see them and question them about your brother
as he speaks orestes and pylades come out of the hut
electra
there they are coming quickly out of the house
old man
they are wellborn but that may ring false for many of the wellborn are base however i give the guests welcome
orestes
welcome old man to which of your friends electra does this ancient remnant of a man belong
electra
this is the one who brought up my father stranger
orestes
what are you saying is this the one who stole away your brother
electra
this is the one who saved him if indeed he is still alive
orestes
oh why does he look at me as if he were examining the clear mark impressed on a silver coin is he comparing me to someone
electra
perhaps he is glad to see in you a companion of orestes
orestes
a beloved man yes but why is he circling all around me
electra
i too am amazed looking at this stranger
old man
o mistress daughter electra pray to the gods
electra
for what thing present or absent
old man
to have a beloved treasure which the god is revealing
electra
see i call on the gods or whatever do you mean old man
old man
look now at this man my child your dearest one
electra
i have been looking for a long time to see whether you have lost your mind
old man
lost my mind because i see your brother
electra
what do you mean old man by this word unhoped for
old man
that i see orestes here agamemnons son
electra
what mark do you see by which i shall be persuaded
old man
a scar along his brow where he fell and drew blood one day in his fathers home when chasing a fawn with you
electra
what are you saying i see the sign of the fall
old man
then do you hesitate to embrace your dearest one
electra
not any longer old man for my heart is persuaded by your tokens o you who have appeared at last i hold you beyond all hope
orestes
and you are held by me at last
electra
i never expected it
orestes
nor did i hope
electra
are you that one
orestes
yes your one ally if i draw back the cast of the net i am aiming for but i have confidence or else we must no longer believe in gods if wrong is to be victorious over right
chorus
you have come you have come oh longdelayed day you have lighted up you have made visible a beacon to the city who in long ago exile went forth from his fathers house unhappily wandering
a god now a god brings our victory my dear lift up your hands lift up your words send prayers to the gods for your brother with fortune with fortune
to enter the city
orestes
well i have the loving pleasures of your greeting and later i will give them back in turn you old man for you have come at the right time tell me what should i do to avenge myself on my fathers murderer
and on my motherthe partner in his unholy marriage do i still have any welldisposed friends in argos or am i wholly bankrupt just as my fortunes are with whom shall i ally myself by night or day what course shall i take against my enemies
old man
child you have no friend in your misfortune for this thing is a godsend indeed to share in common both good and bad but you for you have been destroyed from the foundations in the eyes of your friends and you have left them no hope hear it from me and know
all that you have is in your own arm and fortune to win your fathers home and your city
orestes
what must i do then to accomplish this
old man
kill thyestes son and your mother
orestes
i have come for that victors crown but how shall i grasp it
old man
not by going within the walls even if you wanted to
orestes
is he well furnished with garrisons and bodyguards
old man
you have understood for clearly he is afraid of you and does not sleep
orestes
well it is for you to plan the next step old man
old man
hear me then for something has just come to me
orestes
may you reveal something good and may i understand it
old man
i saw aegisthus when i was on my way here
orestes
i approve what you have said where was he
old man
near these fields at his stables
orestes
what was he doing i see some hope out of difficulties
old man
he was preparing a feast for the nymphs i thought
orestes
in return for the bringing up of children or for a coming birth
old man
i only know this he was preparing to sacrifice an ox
orestes
with how many men or alone with his slaves
old man
no argive was there but a band of his own servants
orestes
surely there isnt anyone who will know me if he sees me old man
old man
there are slaves who have never even seen you
orestes
would they be well disposed to me if i should prevail
old man
yes for that is the way of slaves luckily for you
orestes
however might i approach him then
old man
by going where he will see you as he sacrifices
orestes
he has fields by the road it seems
old man
yes and when he sees you there he will invite you to the feast
orestes
i shall be a bitter companion in the feast if the god wishes it
old man
after that you yourself invent something as it falls out
orestes
well said but my mother where is she
old man
at argos but she will join her husband for the feast
orestes
why didnt my mother set out with her husband
old man
from fear of the citizens reproach she stayed behind
orestes
i understand she knows that the city suspects her
old man
something like that for an unholy woman is an object of hatred
orestes
how then shall i kill her and him at once
electra
i shall prepare my mothers slaughter
orestes
and as for the other fortune will ordain well
electra
let this man here help us with both
old man
i will but how will you find a way to kill your mother
electra
go to clytemnestra old man and say this report that i have given birth to a male child
old man
that you have given birth some time ago or quite recently
electra
ten days ago in which a woman who has given birth stays pure
old man
and how does this grant us the slaughter of your mother
electra
she will come when she hears of my childbirth pangs
old man
how is that do you think she cares for you child
electra
yes and she will weep surely over my childs low rank
old man
perhaps bring your story back again to the turningpoint
electra
well then if she comes it is clear that she will die
old man
yes she will come right up to the door of your house
electra
wont it then be a little thing for her to turn aside to hades
old man
may i die once i have seen this
electra
first of all old man guide my brother
old man
to the place where aegisthus is now sacrificing to the gods
electra
then going to meet my mother give her my message
old man
so that the very words will seem to have been said by you
electra
to orestes
your work begins at once you have drawn the first lot in the slaughter
orestes
i would go if some one would show me the way
old man
yes i can escort you myself not against my will
orestes
o zeus god of my fathers be also the vanquisher of my enemies
electra
and have pity on us for we have suffered pitiably
old man
yes indeed have pity on your own descendants
electra
and hera you who rule mycenaes altars
orestes
give us victory if we are asking for what is right
old man
yes indeed give them the right of vengeance for their father
orestes
you too father living below the earth through an unholy deed
electra
and lady earth to whom i give my hands
old man
defend defend these your dearest children
orestes
now come and bring with you all the dead as allies
electra
those who destroyed the trojans in war with you
old man
and all who hate the unholy and polluted
electra
do you hear me you who suffered dreadful things from my mother
old man
your father hears everything i know but it is time to be on our way
electra
and i tell you therefore that aegisthus is to die if you fall dead in the struggle i am also dead do not count me as alive for i will strike my heart with a twoedged sword i will go indoors and make things ready there
so that if a good report comes from you the whole house will cry aloud in triumph but if you die it will be the opposite of that these are my words to you
orestes
i know it all
electra
therefore you must be a man
orestes pylades the old man and attendants depart
and you women please take care to give
a shout in signal of this contest i will keep a sword ready holding it in my hand for i will not ever if defeated submit to my enemies the right to insult my body
electra goes into the hut
chorus
the story remains in old legends
that pan the keeper of wild beasts breathing sweetvoiced music on his welljoined pipes once brought from its tender mother on argive hills
a lamb with beautiful golden fleece a herald stood on the stone platform and cried aloud to assembly mycenaeans go to assembly
to see the omens given to our blessed rulers    and they honored the house of atreus
chorus
the altars of beaten gold were set out and through the town the
altar fires of the argives blazed the flute handmaid of the muses song sounded its note sweetly and lovely songs of the golden lamb swelled forth saying that thyestes had the luck for he
persuaded atreus own wife to secret love and carried off to his house the portent coming before the assembly he declared that he had in his
house the horned sheep with fleece of gold
chorus
then it was then that zeus changed the radiant paths of the stars and the light of the sun and the
bright face of dawn and the sun drove across the western back of the sky with hot flame from heavens fires while the rainclouds went northward and ammons
lands grew parched and faint not knowing moisture robbed of heavens fairest showers of rain
chorus
it is said but i have small belief in it that the sun turned round his glowing
throne of gold changing it to the misfortune of mankind for the punishment of mortals but tales that frighten men are profitable for service to the gods of whom you had no thought when you
killed your husband you who are the relative of famous brothers
chorus leader
oh oh my friends did you hear a noise or did an empty notion come to me like the underground rumbling from zeus look the breeze rises bringing with it a sign
mistress electra leave the house
electra
rushing out
my friends what is it how do we stand in the contest
leader
i only know this i hear a wailing that means bloodshed
electra
i heard it also far off but still heard
leader
yes the sound is coming a long way but it is clear
electra
the groan was of an argive was it from my friends
leader
i dont know for the whole tune of the shout is confused
electra
you are calling out to me my death why do i delay
leader
hold back to learn your fortune clearly
electra
no no we are vanquished where are the messengers
leader
they will come it is no trivial matter to kill a king
a messenger enters in haste
messenger
o victorious maidens of mycenae i report to all his friends that orestes has conquered and aegisthus the murderer of agamemnon lies on the ground but we must offer prayers to the gods
electra
who are you how trustworthy is your announcement
messenger
dont you know your brothers servant when you look at me
electra
o best of friends i could not recognize your face out of fear but now i know you well what are you saying is my fathers hated murderer dead
messenger
he is dead i am telling you twice what you certainly want to hear
electra
o gods and allseeing justice at last you have come in what way and by what form of death did he kill thyestes son i would like to learn
messenger
messenger
after we had left this house
we stepped onto the broad highway and went to the place where the famous king of mycenae was he turned out to be walking in a wellwatered garden plucking a wreath of tender myrtlesprays for his head when he saw us he called out welcome strangers who are you
and from where do you come from what country orestes said we are thessalians going to the alpheus river to sacrifice to olympian zeus when aegisthus heard that he said you must be my guests for the feast
with us now for i happen to be sacrificing an ox to the nymphs and if you get out of bed at dawn it will make no difference to you but let us go within while he was addressing us he took us by the hand and led us off the road you must not refuse
and when we were in the house he gave the command let someone bring water immediately for my guests so that they may stand around the altar near the basin but orestes said just now we purified ourselves in clean water from the rivers streams
so if strangers must join in the sacrifice with citizens aegisthus we are ready and will not refuse lord
so they ended their public conversation the slaves who formed the masters bodyguard laid aside their spears and all applied their hands to the work
some brought the bowl to catch the blood others took up baskets while others kindled fire and set cauldrons around the hearth and the whole roof rang then your mothers bedfellow took barley for sprinkling and cast it upon the altar with these words
nymphs of the rocks may i and my wife the daughter of tyndareus often sacrifice at home in good fortune as now and may my enemies suffer meaning you and orestes but my master prayed for the opposite not speaking the words aloud
that he might win his fathers house aegisthus took from a basket a long straight knife and cutting off some of the calfs hair laid it with his right hand on the sacred fire and then cut the calfs throat when the servants had lifted it upon their shoulders and said this to your brother
they boast that this is among the honorable accomplishments for the thessalians to cut up a bull rightly and to tame horses take the knife stranger and show us if the report about the thessalians is true
orestes seized in his hands the wellhammered dorian knife and
threw from his shoulders his graceful buckled robe he chose pylades as an assistant in the work and drove back the servants and taking the calf by the hoof he laid bare its white flesh with arm outstretched and flayed the hide quicker than a runner
finishes the two laps of the horses racecourse and then he laid the flanks open aegisthus took the entrails in his hands and inspected them now the liver had no lobe while the portal vein and nearby gallbladder revealed threatening approaches to the one who was observing it
aegisthus was angry but my master asked why are you disheartened stranger i fear some treachery from abroad agamemnons son is the man i hate most and an enemy to my house but orestes said do you really fear treachery from an exile
when you rule the city instead of the dorian knife let someone bring me a thessalian axe and let me split the breastbone so that we may hold the sacrificial feast he took the axe and cut now aegisthus took up the entrails and was inspecting and sorting them out as he was bending down
your brother rose on tiptoe and struck him on the spine his backbone broke apart with his whole body he struggled up and down and cried out dying hard in his blood
as soon as the servants saw it they rushed to arms
many to fight against two yet pylades and orestes in their bravery stood to face them brandishing their weapons then he said i do not come hostile to this city or to my own servants i the unhappy orestes have avenged myself on the murderer of my father
but do not kill me old servants of my father they when they heard his words held back their spears and he was recognized by an old man who had been long in the household immediately they crowned your brother with a wreath and shouted with joy
and he comes bringing a head to show you not that of the gorgon but of the one you hate aegisthus his death today has paid in blood a bitter debt of blood
chorus
set your step to the dance my dear
like a fawn leaping high up to heaven with joy your brother is victorious and has accomplished the wearing of a crown    beside the streams of alpheus come sing
a glorious victory ode to my dance
electra
o light o blaze of the sun drawn by its team o earth and night all that i saw before now i am free to open my eyes for aegisthus my fathers murderer has fallen
come let me bring out whatever adornment for hair that i have and my house contains friends and i shall wreath the head of my conquering brother
chorus
it is for you to bring adornment now for his head
our dance dear to the muses will go on now those who were once our dear kings will rule our land justly having destroyed the unjust so let the shout harmonious with joy go up
orestes and pylades enter followed by attendants who are bearing the body of aegisthus
electra
o glorious victor orestes son of a father victorious in battle under troy receive this band for the locks of your hair you have come home running a contest of the stadium that was not useless but rather killing
aegisthus the murderer of your father and mine and you his companion pylades taught by a most pious father receive a garland from my hand for you also bear an equal part of the contest with orestes may you always seem to me fortunate
orestes
first believe that the gods electra are the leaders of our fortune and then praise me as the servant of them and of fate i come having killed aegisthus not in word but in deed to add this proof to your knowledge
i am bringing you his corpse which if you wish you may expose as prey for wild animals or impale and press it down on a stake as spoil for birds the children of the air for now he is your slave once called your master
electra
i am ashamed but equally i wish to speak
orestes
what is it speak as you are free from fear
electra
i am ashamed to insult the dead for fear someone might hurl malice at me
orestes
there is no one who would blame you
electra
our citizens are hard to please and love to blame
orestes
speak if you need to say anything sister for we engaged in hostilities with him on terms without truce
electraturning to the corpse of aegisthus
well then which of your evil acts shall i tell of first as a beginning what sort of end shall i make what part of my speech shall i assign to the middle place and yet i never ceased throughout the early mornings
repeating what i wished to say to your face if ever i were free from my old terrors and now i am so i will pay you back with those reproaches i wanted to make when you were alive
you destroyed me and orphaned me
and this man here of a dear father though you were wronged in no way by us and you made a shameful marriage with my mother and killed her husband who led the armies of hellas though you never went to troy you were so foolish that you really expected in marrying my mother that she would not be unfaithful to you
though you were wronging my fathers bed know that whoever ruins anothers wife in secret love and then is forced to take her himself is pitiable if he thinks that the chastity which did not govern her before will do so with him
you lived most miserably although you thought it otherwise you knew well that you had made an unholy marriage and my mother knew that she had in you an impious husband both being wicked she took up your fortune you her evil
among all the argives you would hear this that womans husband not that mans wife although this is a shameful thing for the wife to rule the house and not the husband and i hate those children who are called in the city not the sons of the man their father
but of their mother for when a man makes a remarkable marriage one above his rank there is no talk of the husband but only of the wife
this deceived you the most in your ignorance you professed to be some one strong in your wealth
but that is nothing except to associate with briefly it is nature that is secure not wealth for always standing by it takes away troubles but prosperity when it lives wickedly and with fools flies out of the house flowering for a short time
as to your women i am silent for it is not good for a maiden to speak of this but i will tell riddles that can be understood you were insolent because you had a kings house and were endowed with good looks may i never have a husband with a girls face but one with a mans ways
for the children of the latter cling to a life of arms while the fair ones are only an ornament in the dance
spurning the corpse with her foot
begone knowing nothing of how you were discovered and paid the penalty in time so let no evildoer suppose even if he runs the first step well
that he will get the better of justice until he comes to the end of the finishline and makes the last turn in life
chorus leader
he did terrible things and repaid them to you and orestes for justice has great strength
electra
well then you must carry the body of this man inside
and hide it slaves so that when my mother comes she may not see his corpse before her slaughterpylades and the attendants take the body into the hut
orestes
wait let us go into another matter
electra
what those are not rescuers from mycenae whom i see
orestes
no but the mother who bore me
electra
then finely she walks to the middle of the net  and here she comes splendid in her chariot and dress
orestes
what are we going to do shall we kill our mother
electra
surely pity did not seize you when you saw your mother
orestes
ah how can i kill her when she bore me and brought me up
electra
as she killed your father and mine
orestes
o phoebus you prophesied a great folly
electra
where apollo is a fool who are the wise
orestes
you who declared i was to kill my mother whom it is clearly wrong to kill
electra
how can you be hurt by avenging your father
orestes
i shall stand trial as a matricide though i was pure before
electra
and by not defending your father you will be impious
orestes
i my mother  to whom will i pay the penalty for her murder
electra
and to whom if you give up our fathers vengeance
orestes
was it a fiend who spoke in the likeness of the god
electra
seated on the holy tripod i do not think so
orestes
i cannot believe that this oracle was well prophesied
electra
do not become a coward and fall into unmanliness
orestes
am i to devise the same crafty scheme for her
electra
the same death that you gave to her husband aegisthus
orestes
i will go in it is a dreadful task i am beginning and i will do dreadful things if the gods approve let it be to me the contest is bitter and also sweet
as orestes withdraws into the hut clytemnestra enters in a chariot her attendants are handmaidens attired in gorgeous apparel
chorus
hail queen of the land of argos child of tyndareus
and sister of those two noble sons of zeus who dwell in the fiery heavens among the stars whose honored office it is to save mortals in the high waves welcome i give you worship equal to the blessed gods
for your wealth and great prosperity  now is the time to pay our court to your fortunes welcome o queen
clytemnestra
come out of the wagon trojan maids and take my hand that i may step down from the chariot
the homes of the gods are adorned with phrygian spoils but i have obtained these women choice objects from the land of troy in return for the daughter whom i lost a slight reward but an ornament to my house
electra
and mother for i live as a slave
in this miserable house cast out from my fathers home may i not take that blessed hand of yours
clytemnestra
these slaves are here take no trouble on my account
electra
what you sent me away from home a captive i was taken when my home was taken like these
all of us orphaned of a father
clytemnestra
clytemnestra
well your father laid such plots against those whom least of all he should have his own family i will tell you although when a woman gets an evil reputation her tongue is bitter
in my opinion not rightly but it is correct for those who learn about the matter to hate if it deserves hatred if not why hate at all now tyndareus gave me to your father not so that i or any children i might bear should die
but that man went from the house taking my child with the persuasion of a marriage with achilles to aulis which held the fleet and there he stretched iphigenia over the pyre and cut her white cheek and if as a cure for the capture of the city
or as a  benefit to his house or to save his other children he had killed one on behalf of many i would have pardoned him but because helen was lustful and the one who had her as a wife did not know how to punish the betrayer for these reasons he destroyed my child
well although i was wronged i would not have been angry at this nor would i have killed my husband but he came back to me with a girl raving and possessed and put her in his bed and had two brides at once in the same house
a woman is a foolish thing i dont deny it but this granted whenever a husband goes astray and rejects his own bed the woman is likely to imitate her husband and find another love and then in us the blame shines clearly
while the men who caused this are not badly spoken of now if menelaus had been secretly snatched from his home should i have killed orestes to save menelaus my sisters husband how would your father have endured this and so isnt it right for him to die
when he had killed what was mine since i would have suffered at his hands i killed him i turned where indeed it was possible to go to his enemies for which one of your fathers friends would have joined me in his murder speak if you want to say anything and make your retort with frankness
in what way your father died unfairly
chorus leader
justly spoken but this justice is shameful for a woman should yield to her husband in all things if she has sense anyone who does not agree does not come within the scope of what i say
electra
remember mother those last words of yours giving me frankness towards you
clytemnestra
i say it again and i do not deny it child
electra
then will you treat me badly when you hear it
clytemnestra
no no i will give some pleasure to your heart
electra
i will speak and this is the beginning of my preface oh mother i wish that you had a better heart for though your beauty and helens is worthy to bring you praise yet you two were born true sisters both frivolous not worthy of castor
she was carried off willingly ruined and you have destroyed the bravest man in greece putting forward the excuse that you killed a husband for the sake of a child for they dont know you so well as i do you who before your daughters death was decided
as soon as your husband had started from home were adorning the golden locks of your hair at the mirror a wife who decks herself out for beauty when her husband is gone from home strike her off the list as worthless
there is no need for her to show her pretty face out of doors unless she is seeking some mischief of all the women in hellas you were the only one i know to be joyful when troy was fortunate and with a clouded face when it was weaker since you did not want agamemnon to return from troy
and yet it was in your power to be chaste and rightly you had a husband no worse than aegisthus whom hellas chose to be its commander and when your sister helen had done her work it was possible for you to achieve great fame
for the bad gives a standard of comparison to the good and provides a spectacle
but if as you say my father killed your daughter what is the wrong i and and my brother have done you how was it that after you had killed your husband you did not assign to us our fathers home
but you brought the goods belonging to another to bed buying your marriage with wages and how is it that your husband is not exiled in the place of your son nor has he died in my place although he has killed me alive twice as much as my sister if murder giving judgment requites murder your
son orestes and i must kill you to avenge our father  for if that was just then so is this whoever marries a wicked woman looking to wealth or noble birth is a fool for humble wives if chaste are better in the home than great ones
chorus leader
chance is in the marriages of women among mankind i see some fall out well others not
clytemnestra
child it was always your nature to love your father this is what happens some children are for their fathers others in turn love their mothers more than a father
i will forgive you for i do not rejoice so very much at what i have done child
you a woman who has just given birth why is your body so unwashed and meanly clad
alas for my schemes
i drove on in anger against my husband more than i should have
electra
you sigh too late when you have no remedy my father is dead but why do you not recall that exile your own wandering son
clytemnestra
l am afraid i am looking to my interests not his
for he is angry they say over the murder of his father
electra
and why do you cause your husband to be cruel to me
clytemnestra
such are his ways you have a stubborn nature also
electra
yes for i am in distress yet i will cease from my anger
clytemnestra
and then he will no longer be harsh to you
electra
he is proud for he lives in my home
clytemnestra
you see again you are rekindling new quarrels
electra
i am silent i fear him as i fear him
clytemnestra
stop this talk but why did you summon me child
electra
you have heard i suppose that i have given birth
in thanks for this please sacrifice for i do not know how on the tenth day as is the custom for the child for i have no experience being childless before
clytemnestra
this is work for another the one who delivered you
electra
i was all alone in my labor and at the babys birth
clytemnestra
is this household situated with no friends as neighbors
electra
no one is willing to have the poor as friends
clytemnestra
but i will go to make the tenthday sacrifice to the gods for the child and when i have done you this favor i will go to the field where my husband is sacrificing to the
nymphs take this team away my attendants and bring it to the stalls and when you think that i have finished this sacrifice to the gods be ready for i must also please my husband
electra
go into a poor house but please take care
that my smokegrimed walls do not smear your robes with soot for you will make the sacrifice to the gods that you ought to make
clytemnestra goes into the hut
the basket is ready and the knife sharpened the same that killed the bull by whose side you will lie struck down even in hades house you will be the bride of the one
whom you slept with in life this is the favor i will give you and you will give me retribution for my fatherelectra follows her into the hut
chorus
requital for evils the breezes of the house shift and blow at another time my leader my own fell murdered in the bath
and the roof and stone walls of the house cried aloud while he said o cruelty my wife why are you murdering me on my return to my dear country in the tenth year
chorus
retribution for straying love has flowed back and brings to judgment the one who killed her wretched husband when he came at last to his home and to the towering cyclopean walls with her own hand she killed him with the sharpedged weapon
holding the axe in her hands unhappy husband whatever the curse that possessed that wretched woman like a lioness of the hills that ranges through the meadowland woods she accomplished these things
within
clytemnestra
o children by the gods do not kill your mother
chorus
sung
do you hear her cries within the house
sung
clytemnestra
o god ah me
chorus
i also wail for you overpowered by your children
sung
truly the god deals out justice whenever it befalls
you have suffered cruelly unhappy one yet you did unholy things to your husband
chorus leader
but here they come from the house defiled in the newly shed blood of their mother a triumphal rout evidence of the pitiable sacrifice
there is no house more pitiable than the race of tantalus nor has there ever been
orestes and electra come out of the hut followed by attendants who are carrying the two corpses the following lines between electra orestes and the chorus are chanted
orestes
earth and zeus who sees all mortal acts look at these loathsome bloody deeds these two bodies
lying on the earth at the blow from my hand atonement for my suffering
electra
too many tears my brother and i am the cause unhappy that i came to fiery rage against this woman who was my mother
chorus
alas for your fate you gave birth to unbearable pain and you suffered it miserably and beyond from your children yet you have rightly paid for their fathers murder
orestes
ah phoebus you proclaimed in song unclear justice but you have brought about clear woes and granted me a bloody destiny far from the land of hellas to what other city can i go
what host what pious man will look at me who killed my mother
electra
ah me where can i go to what dance to what marriage what husband will receive me
into the bridal bed
chorus
again again your thought changes with the breeze for now you think piously though you did not before and you did dreadful things
my dear to your unwilling brother
orestes
did you see how the unhappy one threw off her robe and showed her bosom in the slaughter alas hurling to the ground the limbs that gave me birth and her hair i
chorus
i know it well you passed through agony hearing the mournful wail of the mother that bore you
orestes
she uttered this cry putting her hand to my chin
my child i entreat you and she clung to my cheeks so that the sword fell from my hand
chorus
the unhappy one how did you endure to see the blood
of your mother breathing her last before your eyes
orestes
i threw my cloak over my eyes and began the sacrifice by plunging the sword into my mothers throat
electra
and i urged you on and
put my hand to the sword together with you
chorus
you have done the most dreadful of deeds
orestes
take and hide the limbs of our mother beneath a robe and close the wounds
turning to the corpse
ah you gave birth to your own murderers
electra
covering the corpse
there i am putting this cloak over the one loved and not loved
chorus
an end of great troubles for the house
chorus leader
but see the ones who are appearing over the top of the house spirits or gods from heaven
for this path does not belong to men why ever do they come into the clear sight of mortals
the dioskouroi appear from above
dioskouroi
dioskouroi
son of agamemnon listen the twin sons of zeus your mothers brothers
castor and his brother polydeuces are calling you having just now calmed the swell of the sea terrible for ships we have come to argos when we saw the slaying of our sister your mother now she has her just reward but you have not acted justly
and phoebus phoebus but i am silent for he is my lord although he is wise he gave you oracles that were not but it is necessary to accept these things as to what remains you must do what fate and zeus have accomplished for you
give electra to pylades as his wife to take to his home
but you leave argos for it is not for you who killed your mother to set foot in this city and the dread goddesses of death the one who glare like hounds will drive you up and down a maddened wanderer go to athens and embrace the holy image of pallas
for she will prevent them flickering with dreadful serpents from touching you as she stretches over your head her gorgonfaced shield there is a hill of ares where the gods first sat over their votes to decide on bloodshed
when savage ares killed halirrothius son of the oceans ruler in anger for the unholy violation of his daughter so that the tribunal is most sacred and secure in the eyes of the gods
you also must run your risk here for murder
an equal number of votes cast will save you from dying by the verdict for loxias will take the blame upon himself since it was his oracle that advised your mothers murder and this law will be set for posterity that the accused will always win his case if he has equal votes
then the dread goddesses stricken with grief at this will sink into a cleft of the earth beside this hill a holy revered prophetic shrine for mortals you must found an arcadian city beside the streams of alpheus near the sacred enclosure to lycaean apollo
and the city will be called after your name
i say this to you as for this corpse of aegisthus the citizens of argos will cover it in the earth in burial but as for your mother menelaus who has arrived at nauplia only now after capturing troy
will bury her with helen helping him for she has come from proteus house leaving egypt and she never went to troy zeus to stir up strife and bloodshed among mortals sent a phantom of helen to ilium now let pylades having one who is both a virgin and a married woman
go home from the achaean land and let him conduct the one called your brotherinlaw to the land of phocis and give him a weight of riches but you set out along the narrow isthmus and go to cecropias blessed hill
for once you have completed your appointed lot of murder you will be happy freed from these troubles
chorus
the remaining lines of the play are chanted
sons of zeus is it right for us to draw near to speak with you
dioskouroi
it is right for those not polluted by this murder
electra
may i too share your conversation sons of tyndareus
dioskouroi
you too to phoebus i will attribute this bloody deed
chorus
how was it that you being gods and the brothers of this murdered woman
did not keep the deathgoddesses away from her house
dioskouroi
necessitys fate led to what must be and unwise speech from the mouth of phoebus
electra
but what apollo what sort of oracles ordained for me to be my mothers murderer
dioskouroi
the deeds were shared the fates were shared one ancestral curse has ground down both
orestes
ah my sister seeing you after a long time at once i am robbed of your affection
and i must abandon you abandoned by you
dioskouroi
she has a husband and a home she does not suffer pitiably except that she leaves the city of the argives
electra
and what other unhappiness is greater
than to leave the boundary of ones native land
orestes
but i shall leave my fathers house and at a strangers tribunal undergo trial for my mothers murder
dioskouroi
have courage you will go
to the holy town of pallas only hold out
electra
clasp me to your breast my dearest brother for the curse of our mothers blood is separating us from our fathers home
orestes
throw your arms in close embrace about me lament as if i were dead over my grave
dioskouroi
alas you have said things terrible even for gods to hear for in me and in the olympians there is
pity for muchsuffering mortals
orestes
i shall no longer see you
electra
nor will i draw near your sight
orestes
these are my last words to you
electra
farewell my city
and a long farewell to you my fellowcountrywomen
orestes
are you going already most faithful one
electra
i am going my tender eyes wet with tears
orestes
go pylades and be happy marry electra
dioskouroi
marriage will be for them to think of but go towards athens seeking to escape these hounds of hell for they are pursuing you fearfully
the darkskinned ones with snakes for hands holding a reward of dreadful pains but we two must go in haste over the sicilian sea to rescue the seagoing ships as we go through the plains of the air
we do not come to the aid of those who are polluted but we save and release from severe hardships those who love piety and justice in their ways of life and so let no one wish to act unjustly
or set sail with perjurers as a god i give this address to mortalsthe dioskouroi vanish
chorus
farewell any mortal who is able to fare well and is not worn down by any misfortune achieves happiness
